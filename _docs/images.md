# Images

## Banner Images

Banner images are large, full-width banner images, typically used in the header section of a webpage.

### Dimensions

The complex considerations of modern web design make themselves clear when with images. Websites must respond not only to varying screen sizes and orientations, but also pixel density - Dots Per Inch (DPI) - and mobile bandwidth. These problems can be addressed in with new web specifications like the <picture> element, used to display banner images on the Hansard Society website.

This website uses the following image dimensions for banner images:
* 240p: 426x240
* 360p: 640x360
* 480p: 854x480
* 720p: 1280x720
* 1080p: 1920x1080
* 1440p (2k): 2560x1440
* 2160p (4k): 3840 x 2160

__Notes:__
* We upload at 2k or 4k as the image dimensions can be manipulated in the URL. This ensures we always have access to the highest quality image, but donâ€™t sacrifice performance due to URL queries.
* Photos 4:3 (standard dslr and cameraphone)

### Profile images

Profile images are the base images for all contexts where a photo of an individual is displayed, whether in a blog post, testimonial, panel quote or anywhere else.

#### Dimensions and specifications

* 600 x 400px
* Black and white
