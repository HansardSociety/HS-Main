  Why even casting your ballot in school elections can have a lasting effect on youth political engagement
  {: .byline }
:copy: "The youth vote was an important theme in the run up to the 2015 general election,
  and it was heartening to see so many different organisations try to reach out to
  young voters. Whether it was [Bite the Ballot](https://twitter.com/BiteTheBallot)
  or [Channel 4’s E4](http://www.channel4.com/e4), all worked to try to ensure young
  people got their say on May 7th.\n\nThese campaigns largely focus on young people
  who are over the age of 18 and eligible to vote in this election. But schools and
  teachers can play an important role even before their students reach the age of
  majority. In addition to formal Citizenship classes, schools also provide activities
  that give students a chance to learn about democracy through ‘hands-on’ experience.
  Some of the most popular (and effective) activities in this vein are school councils,
  debating teams, and [mock elections](http://www.mockelections.co.uk/), which the
  [Hansard Society](http://www.hansardsociety.org.uk) has been supporting for 50 years.
  \ \n\nAnalysis of the [Citizenship Education Longitudinal Study in England](http://www.llakes.ac.uk/research-project/166/citizenship-education-longitudinal-survey-cels)
  (CELS) shows that hands-on activities like these can have a positive impact on young
  people’s attitudes towards politics. Moreover, these benefits are not temporary.
  We found that students who participated in mock elections, debating teams and/ or
  school councils were more likely to have positive attitudes towards political participation
  even after they had left school. And it’s not just voting that these activities
  encourage; our participants were also more likely to report that they had taken
  part in non-electoral types of participation, such as boycotting products, contacting
  politicians, and using social media for political purposes. These positive benefits
  were found even after we controlled for other factors that are known to boost political
  participation among adults (such as high levels of education and high socio-economic
  status). In other words, mock elections and school councils don’t just benefit middle
  class students or young people who are already politically engaged. \n\n## Why does
  hands-on learning leave a lasting impression?\n\nThere are several reasons why activities
  like these provide such an important (and lasting) impression on youth attitudes.
  For one, these activities allow young people to acquire practical as well as cognitive
  skills. For example, mock elections give students an opportunity to participate
  in (mock) election campaigns and to run as candidates. In the process, students
  practice politically-relevant skills such as public speaking; formulating and communicating
  opinions about political issues; negotiating with others; and learning to work in
  groups. \n\nEven simply filling in the mock ballot paper can be beneficial, as it
  not only allows students to become familiar with how to cast their vote, but it
  can get young people into the habit of participation.  Many political scientists
  believe that voting is a habit and that people are more likely to vote if they have
  done so in the past. Young people typically do not get a chance to form this habit
  until after the age of 18, but mock elections can help to start the habit-formation
  process.\n\nSchools also send an important message to young people when they give
  them opportunities to practice democracy at school. In particular, these activities
  help to reinforce the social norm that political participation is worthwhile.  Exposing
  young people to this idea while they are at secondary school is particularly important.
  Adolescence is a formative period and the norms, identities and habits that are
  formed during this period persist into adulthood and help to shape political participation
  in later life.  \n\nMore importantly, by offering these activities schools are also
  signalling that young people’s opinions matter. This can help young people to feel
  more included, and boost their confidence and sense of efficacy. Young people are
  more likely to take part if they feel that their voice will be heard, and that their
  efforts will make a difference. \n\nOf course, simply holding mock elections in
  schools will not address all of the challenges surrounding youth political engagement.
  \ If only it were that easy. Families, political parties, NGOs and the media must
  also play their role in engaging young people with politics. And of course schools
  need to be given adequate support and resources in order to play their part. Politicians
  regularly pronounce their support for citizenship education, but if any type of
  citizenship education is to be effective, policy announcements in this vein must
  be backed-up with sustained political commitment, practical support for schools,
  and trained teachers. Without these vital resources, it will be difficult to live
  up to the potential that different types of citizenship education can have and give
  youth political engagement the boost it still clearly needs.\n\n---\n\nThis post
  draws on a research paper that will be published in the [Hansard Society's quarterly
  journal Parliamentary Affairs](http://pa.oxfordjournals.org/) in the coming weeks.
