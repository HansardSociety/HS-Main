:title: Corbyn's 'Save Our Steel' e-petition shows why the rules governing the recall
  of Parliament need to change
:slug: corbyns-save-our-steel-e-petition-shows-why-the-rules-governing-the-recall
:introduction: In a time of crisis Parliament is hamstrung if it is in recess. MPs
  are not masters of their own House because, in accordance with House of Commons
  Standing Order 13, only government ministers - in reality the Prime Minister - can
  request a recall of Parliament.
:copy: "At the time of writing, a bizarre situation has developed in the last 24 hours.
  The Leader of Her Majesty’s official opposition has resorted to launching [an e-petition
  on the House of Commons’ own e-petitions site](https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/126128)
  in order to build public support for the recall of Parliament so that it can debate
  and hold the government to account for its stance on the future of the steel industry.
  \n\n##What will happen to the e-petition?\n\nNow that the petition has reached 100,000
  signatures the Petitions Committee will consider whether it should be debated. But
  here’s the problem. The Committee is not scheduled to sit again until 12 April.
  Committees can and do meet during recess periods if they wish so it could choose
  to meet in the coming week to consider it. But even if it did, it can’t recall the
  House of Commons to debate the issue, any more than the Leader of the Opposition
  can. \n\nSo, regardless of how many signatures the e-petition attracts, a debate
  can only be held once Parliament is sitting again (it is scheduled to return from
  recess on 11 April), by which time the specific action sought in the e-petition,
  namely the recall of Parliament, will be irrelevant. \n\n##How should the House
  of Commons be empowered to decide on recall? \n\nIt is nonsensical that any MP,
  let alone the Leader of the Opposition, has to resort to the e-petitions system
  to generate public support for recall because they have no route within Parliament
  itself to get the matter properly considered.\n\nFifteen years ago our Commission
  on Parliamentary Scrutiny argued that if Parliament was to be an effective forum
  at times of crisis, and retain its significance to public debate, then the rules
  governing recall had to be revised. \n\nWe suggested that the Speaker be granted
  the power to recall Parliament at times of emergency if one or more MPs requested
  it and following consultation with the party leaders. But if MPs don’t want to vest
  the power of decision entirely with the Speaker then an alternative formula could
  easily be devised: for example, the support of a set percentage of MPs might be
  required to instigate a recall, perhaps with the additional requirement that there
  be evidence of cross-party support with representation from at least three parties
  in the House. \n\nParliament has been recalled on 28 occasions since 1948. The most
  recent was in September 2014 to debate military intervention in Iraq. Indeed, the
  majority of recalls are brought about because of international crises and military
  action. Recalls because of an economic or domestic situation are rare but not unknown.
  The steel crisis may not rank as a national emergency on the scale of the devaluation
  of sterling in 1949 or the fuel state of emergency in 1974. But it is arguably a
  much more pressing issue of urgent national importance than the death of Margaret
  Thatcher in April 2013 and the Queen Mother in April 2002 for which Parliament was
  recalled on both occasions in order to pay tribute.\n\nThe disparity in importance
  of the national events underpinning previous recalls of Parliament reinforces the
  case for taking the issue away from the government of the day and vesting it with
  the legislature, where open and transparent consideration of the case for recall
  in each instance can be made and Members held accountable accordingly.\n\nThe key
  point is that the request should come from the House and be decided by the House
  through the Speaker. It should make the decision not the government. \n\n##Should
  MPs be able to register e-petitions? \n\nAlthough the use of an e-petition may be
  understandable in the circumstances, if MPs resort to using them for campaign purposes
  such as this then there is a risk it will undermine the purpose and integrity of
  the system. The parliamentary e-petitions system exists so that the public can petition
  their elected representatives, not so that MPs can petition their colleagues. \n\nIn
  [our report on reform of the e-petitions system](http://www.hansardsociety.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/What-next-for-e-petitions.pdf)
  we recommended that because MPs have plenty of mechanisms through which to make
  their views known they should not be permitted to register petitions on the parliamentary
  site. The House of Commons adopted many of the recommendations in our report when
  they revised the e-petitions system at the start of this Parliament but they did
  not endorse this one. Given this week’s events that may need to be revisited sooner
  rather than later. \n\n##What’s the risk of reputational damage for MPs and Parliament?
  \ \n\nThe optics of this in terms of public perceptions of Parliament are horrible.
  \n\nAs our annual [Audit of Political Engagement showed last year](http://www.auditofpoliticalengagement.org/media/reports/Audit-of-Political-Engagement-12-2015.pdf),
  only one in four people (26%) think Parliament holds government to account, and
  only one in five (19%) think it debates and makes decisions that matter to them.
  This far from positive perception of the institution is hardly likely to be enhanced
  by this week’s events. \n\nWe also know from the Audit that the further away from
  Westminster citizens live, the less likely they are to regard Parliament positively.
  If Parliament fails to respond in a timely way to problems like this then to thousands
  of people affected across the country - many of them in Wales and the North of England
  – it risks looking desperately out of touch and irrelevant to their lives. \n\nIf
  it is not recalled, Parliament will look even more cut off from the cares and concerns
  of ordinary people when the National Assembly for Wales reconvenes next Monday (4
  April). The Assembly has been recalled by the Presiding Officer at the request of
  the First Minister because she considers the ‘current situation facing the Welsh
  steel industry to be of urgent public importance’. \n\nThe Assembly does not officially
  dissolve for the elections until 6 April, but in practical terms business ceased
  in the middle of March and many Assembly Members have already abandoned their offices
  and dispensed with using the Assembly IT and communication systems. And they won’t
  be able to meet in the Chamber next week because the seats and desks have been taken
  out so a new IT system can be fitted – instead they will meet in the Siambr Hywel,
  their former debating chamber in the next door Ty Hywel building. \n\nThe juxtaposition
  of images will not favour Westminster. On the one hand AMs pitching up in a temporary
  residence, the gravity of the situation facing their constituents outweighing the
  practical problems facing the Assembly in reconvening in these circumstances. And
  then MPs, still ‘on holiday’ in a time of crisis. It will be unfair criticism, as
  the decision not to reconvene will have been made not by MPs collectively but by
  the resident in Downing Street alone and the majority of MPs will be busy in their
  constituencies, not lying on a beach. But it will be MPs and Parliament collectively
  that suffer the reputational consequences. "
