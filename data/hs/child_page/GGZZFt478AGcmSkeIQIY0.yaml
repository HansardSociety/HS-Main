:title: It's Brexit… So What Now for Parliament?
:slug: its-brexit-so-what-now-for-parliament
:introduction: A referendum is a blunt political instrument to deal with complex political
  questions, but now that it is over Parliament will have to deal with the consequences
  after what has been a difficult campaign. Below are some of our early thoughts.
:copy: "**A general election?** \n\nThe Fixed Term Parliament Act 2011 sets the date
  of the general election in 2020. This legislative straitjacket makes it difficult
  but not impossible to hold an early election should the new Prime Minister and government
  decide they need a fresh mandate. There is no discretion for the Prime Minister
  or the Monarch on this issue. There are legally only two routes to secure it. \n\nThe
  first is that two thirds of all MPs – 433 – vote for a motion calling for one. No
  single party can command that level of support so it would require a significant
  proportion of both Conservative and opposition MPs to vote for it. But to do so
  would need the parties to mutually conclude that an election would be in their interests
  at this point in time. \n\nThe alternative route is for a simple majority to be
  secured on a motion “That this House has no confidence in Her Majesty’s government”.
  There would then be a 14-day period during which consideration could be given to
  possible alternative administrations and who can command the confidence of the House
  of Commons. To enjoy the confidence of the House of Commons does not require that
  a government command the positive support of a majority of the House, merely that
  no combination of parties can form a majority against it. If no alternative emerges,
  and therefore a motion of confidence cannot be secured within the 14 days, a general
  election would be called. \n\nThe Electoral Registration and Administration Act
  2013 made provision for lengthening the general election timetable from the previous
  17 days to 25 days. This came into force with The Electoral Registration and Administration
  Act 2013 (Commencement No 5 and Transitory Provisions) Order 2014. The 25-day timetable
  does not include weekends and bank holidays (and any day appointed for public thanksgiving
  or mourning). In practice it therefore means a five-week election timetable. \n\nThroughout
  this period Parliament would be dissolved and, unlike during recess periods, it
  could not be recalled. There is no legal mechanism to restore MPs in the old Parliament
  on a temporary basis. The proclamation dissolving Parliament for the election will
  set out the date of summons for the new Parliament. In the interim, no Parliament
  exists.\n\nSo, if politically, a general election could be secured under the terms
  of the Fixed Term Parliament Act, there would follow a minimum five-week period
  between dissolution and assembly of the new Parliament when there would be no parliamentary
  oversight of the executive. Given the volatile economic and  constitutional environment
  this may be deemed unsatisfactory. \n\nIf it was deemed politically desirable, and
  there was sufficient support for it in both Houses of Parliament, the Fixed Term
  Parliaments Act and the Electoral Registration and Administration Act 2013 (Commencement
  No 5 and Transitory Provisions) Order 2014 could both be amended or replaced to
  facilitate a general election in the new circumstances. The Fixed Term Parliaments
  Act cannot simply be repealed as Parliament would exist in perpetuity for there
  would be no legal provision to bring it to an end. \n\n**Parliamentary scrutiny**
  \n\nThe decision to leave the EU may herald significant changes in the way Parliament,
  and particularly the House of Commons, operates. \n\nMPs will want some oversight
  of negotiations over the two-year departure period once Article 50 of the Treaty
  of Lisbon is triggered and they will ultimately have a vote on the final exit Treaty(s).
  \n\nThe scrutiny work that lies ahead will be detailed, complex and technical. MPs
  already struggle to effectively scrutinise financial and delegated legislation and
  this will add to the burden. Serious consideration therefore needs to be given to
  a bi-cameral solution to the scrutiny process given that Peers tend to have greater
  appetite for and experience of such scrutiny. It would be in both Houses’ interest
  not to duplicate work. \n\n**Chamber and Committees** \n\nIn the Commons a regular
  ministerial question time may well be demanded, debates about the way ahead will
  be a regular feature and the Urgent Question is likely to be a key tool as backbenchers
  try to hold ministers to account. Similar provisions for question time and debates
  are likely to be requested in the House of Lords. \n\nA stand-alone select committee
  or a joint committee of both Houses may be required to monitor the negotiations
  and decision-making, although existing departmental select committees will want
  to oversee their own particular departmental policy area. As a consequence we will
  likely see greater efforts at joint working across committees. Consideration will
  need to be given to how to knit together the new scrutiny work with that of existing
  committees that are tasked with scrutinising EU legislation, specifically the European
  Scrutiny Committee in the Commons and the EU Committee in the Lords. \n\nThe Liaison
  Committee of select committee chairs currently questions the Prime Minister three
  times a year – they may want an increase in these sessions. \n\nParliament may require
  additional staff and support and there will, from time to time, be a need to bring
  in specialist expertise, which will bring its own costs. When the bicameral Banking
  Commission inquiry, modelled similarly to a select committee was set up a couple
  of years ago it consumed resources. The requirement for scrutinising our departure
  from the EU will be on a much greater, and longer-term scale and the resource need
  will therefore be higher. Effective scrutiny will not be cheap but should not be
  stinted upon.\n\n**Legislative scrutiny** \n\nIronically, although advocates of
  leave campaigned ostensibly to restore the influence of Parliament, in reality the
  government not the legislature will be empowered in the short term by Brexit. \n\nReviewing
  the corpus of EU law will be an enormously challenging task if mistakes and anomalies
  that plunge people into grey areas of legal uncertainty are to be avoided. At the
  heart of the leave campaign’s roadmap for navigating an exit path is their proposal
  for a European Union Law (Emergency Provisions) Bill which would amend but not repeal
  the European Communities Act 1972. But decisions will have to be taken about whether
  to keep, amend or repeal all the regulations made under Section 2.2 of the 1972
  Act otherwise they will automatically lapse on its repeal. \n\nGiven the volume
  of legislation involved, in practice much of the heavy lifting will probably have
  to be done via delegation and through statutory instruments. This will empower the
  executive not Parliament and, given the complete inadequacies of Commons procedures
  for scrutinising delegated legislation, will frustrate MPs, not least because they
  do not currently have the power of amendment. The passage of this legislation may
  also be unduly complicated and time consuming given the need to determine the EVEL
  designation of each new SI for scrutiny purposes. \n\nThe process may also give
  rise, once again, to questions about the relationship between the Commons and Lords.
  As things stand, the Upper House retains its right to reject Statutory Instruments
  but does so very rarely. If the government does not enact the proposals in the Strathclyde
  Review then it is not inconceivable that the two Houses could clash on the detail
  of these SI’s in future if Peers feel that errors are being made in the review and
  amendment process. Delegated legislation, unlike primary legislation is also subject
  to judicial review so the door will remain open to potential legal challenge if
  problems arise. \n\nThe Procedure Committee of the House of Commons initiated an
  inquiry into the scrutiny of delegated legislation before the last election but
  it made little headway. The Committee may wish to restart this inquiry and, once
  the government confirms the exit negotiating process, it may wish to initiate an
  inquiry into how the House of Commons scrutiny machinery can best be established
  to mirror the negotiating model.  \n\nIf no changes to the scrutiny process are
  implemented, then under current arrangements the bulk of the scrutiny burden for
  SIs will fall on the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments and the Secondary
  Legislation Scrutiny Committee. In the last session (2015-16), 741 SIs were laid
  by the government before Parliament for scrutiny. In the second session of a Parliament,
  the number tends to creep up to nearer 1,000. In their current form it is therefore
  likely to be beyond the capacity of these committees to consider the existing output
  of SIs alongside new SIs arising from decisions made in relation to the European
  Communities Act. \n\n**What happens to the current legislative programme?** \n\nNine
  bills have been published and await the conclusion of the parliamentary scrutiny
  process, and a further 16 have been promised but have not yet emerged. \n\nIt is
  currently unclear what will happen to them, having been drafted with regard to the
  UK’s obligations under EU law. \n\nAs the Prime Minister has announced his intention
  to resign we effectively have a caretaker government in all but name. It is likely
  that little further legislative progress will therefore be made pending the appointment
  of the new Prime Minister and Cabinet. Key decisions that were expected after the
  referendum such as a new runway at Heathrow and renewal of Trident may similarly
  be put on ice. \n\nThe Leader of the House of Commons would normally make a business
  statement to the House on Thursday morning. In the circumstances, however, an earlier
  statement may need to be made when Parliament reconvenes on Monday. Clarification
  may emerge in any statement the Prime Minister makes to the House on Monday or the
  Leader of the House may follow up with a separate statement setting out any changes
  to business in the coming weeks. A similar statement would be required in the House
  of Lords. \n\nOnce a new Prime Minister and Cabinet are chosen, if there is to be
  no general election, then they will have to set out their plans through statements
  to Parliament and, if deemed necessary, a new budget and accompanying Finance Bill.
  \n\n**Relations with the devolved legislatures** \n\nA number of key constitutional
  challenges will also need to be addressed. For example, under the devolved model,
  key areas of policy where EU law applies are subject not to Westminster but the
  devolved legislatures. \n\nThe Scottish Parliament is required to legislate compatibly
  with the EU. The Scotland Act 1998 will therefore need to be amended which will
  require the consent of the Scottish Parliament. Given Scottish support for staying
  in the EU, it is unclear where such a constitutional stand off would lead if that
  consent was withheld. Similar issues will also arise with the National Assembly
  for Wales and the Northern Ireland Assembly. \n\nHistorically, communication between
  Westminster and the three devolved legislatures has been poor. Relations tend to
  be conducted on a government to government basis, and the devolved government then
  engages with its own legislature on the issues concerned. This has resulted in misunderstandings
  in legislative drafting and the devolved legislatures being left out of the loop
  about developments with one of their sister legislatures that might have longer-term
  implications for themselves. In addition to whatever processes are put in place
  at the Whitehall level for the inter-governmental negotiations, either through the
  Inter-governmental Council or a new body, Parliament may therefore wish to set up
  a four member inter-parliamentary committee arrangement to shadow the negotiating
  process. \n\n**Restoration and renewal** \n\nSo the constitutional and legislative
  challenges and the sheer volume of work will be enormous, and it is unclear how
  it will all fit alongside the current day-to-day workload of the government’s existing
  legislative plans. And of course, all this will have to be done alongside preparations
  for the proposed multi-billion pound refurbishment of the Palace of Westminster.
  The ‘restoration and renewal’ programme is a one in 150 year opportunity to reform
  the leading institution of our democracy. It will now take place in a very different
  political environment to the one we were thinking about just weeks ago. But it also
  presents a real opportunity to reinvent the way we legislate and the culture and
  practice of parliamentary politics in a manner fit for our new future. \n\n*You
