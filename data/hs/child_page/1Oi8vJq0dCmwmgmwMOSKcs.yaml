:title: "'Bonfire of the quangos' legislation fizzles out"
:slug: bonfire-of-the-quangos-legislation-fizzles-out
:introduction: The forthcoming Great Repeal Bill will be the most prominent piece
  of enabling legislation[^1] since the controversial Public Bodies Act 2011.
:copy: "The main provisions of that Act were heavily criticised at the time for the
  substantial Henry VIII powers it delegated to the executive. Its shortcomings should
  act as a warning to parliamentarians when considering similar powers within the
  Great Repeal Bill.\n\nToday (14 February 2017) marks the end of the road for the
  ‘bonfire of the quangos’ and the controversial delegated powers that implemented
  the 2010-15 coalition government’s review of public bodies.\n\nIn a series of Henry
  VIII clauses, which give powers to ministers to amend and repeal primary legislation
  by secondary legislation, the Public Bodies Act 2011 allowed ministers to abolish,
  merge or amend the constitutional and funding arrangements of a number of public
  bodies listed in the Act’s schedules by Order. Today, those schedules lapse, with
  the remaining parts of the Act continuing on the statute book.\n\nParliament spent
  14 months considering the Bill. During this time it was heavily criticised for the
  ‘wide and ill-defined’ legislative powers delegated to the executive. As a consequence,
  procedural safeguards were added in the House of Lords, creating Public Bodies Orders
  (PBOs), a new variant on the strengthened scrutiny procedure, which subjects certain
  powers to a higher level of parliamentary scrutiny than the affirmative procedure,
  and of which there are now 11 variants. \n\nBy the time Royal Assent was achieved
  on 14 December 2011, 285 public bodies were listed in the Act’s schedules, with
  the government envisaging that 58 Public Bodies Orders would be laid before the
  Act came to an end. \n\nHowever, in the five years since the Act came into effect,
  the ‘bonfire of the quangos’ has failed to ignite. Only 31 (53%) of the 58 PBOs
  originally intended have been laid before Parliament, amending only 53 of the 285
  public bodies set out in the Act’s schedules.[^2]  \n\nNo Public Bodies Orders have
  been laid since December 2014, and the House of Lords Secondary Legislation Scrutiny
  Committee (SLSC), the committee charged with scrutinising PBOs on behalf of the
  Upper House, has noted that a third of PBO proposals were dropped by the government
  within two years of the Act’s Royal Assent. Given that over 100 hours were spent
  in Parliament scrutinising the Bill, the SLSC rightly reiterated its concern that
  the outcome is ‘disproportionately small’ in comparison to the amount of parliamentary
  time and resource expended. \n\nThe SLSC has gone further in its criticism of what
  it calls the government’s, ‘unacceptably cavalier approach to the use of Parliament’s
  time’, in respect of the government’s decision to use pre-existing legislation,
  in the form of the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013, to abolish the Agricultural
  Dwelling House Advisory Committees and Agricultural Wages Board for England and
  Wales, instead of the PBO procedure, as originally intended. \n\nThe government
  has since responded by stating that the primary objective was to achieve its programme
  of public bodies reform, and, ‘how this was delivered, whether through the Act or
  through other means, was secondary’.[^3] It is questionable whether this was understood
  by parliamentarians during the Bill’s passage. MPs and peers spent a significant
  amount of time debating procedure and the means of delivery; time that could have
  been used debating important matters of policy. \n\nIn its post-legislative assessment
  of the Act published last December, the SLSC concluded by noting with concern the
  government’s ‘continued misunderstanding’ of the nature of the Public Bodies Order
  procedure, and in particular, the belief that creating a Henry VIII power and subjecting
  it to a strengthened scrutiny procedure would ‘avoid the need for time and resource-demanding
  individual pieces of legislation or amendments to other legislation’.[^4] \n\nBut,
  as noted in a [previous blog](http://blog.hansardsociety.org.uk/will-the-great-repeal-bill-be-another-abolition-of-parliament-bill/),
  it can take just as long to steer instruments subject to some of the 11 variants
  of strengthened scrutiny procedure through Parliament as it does a piece of primary
  legislation, negating the advantages of legislating with speed and flexibility rather
  than putting the matters on the face of the Bill.\n\nFor example, it can take between
  11 and 18 months to complete a Legislative Reform Order, arising from the 2006 Legislative
  and Regulatory Reform Act which permits a minister to remove regulatory burdens
  in primary legislation. As a result, only 32 Legislative Reform Orders have been
  laid since the legislation received Royal Assent in 2006. \n\nWhilst quicker than
  a Bill, it took on average just over three months for a PBO to complete its passage
  through Parliament, consuming considerably more time and resource than a usual affirmative
  instrument. The Public Bodies (Abolition of Administrative Justice and Tribunals
  Council) Order 2013 was signed-off 8 months after it was laid before Parliament.
  \n\n**Lessons for the Great Repeal Bill?**\n\n\nThe Public Bodies Act provides a
  salutary example of ministers claiming delegated powers in instances where policy
  proposals are not fully formulated, and of the consequences when insufficient consideration
  has been given to how those powers will actually be used. This is especially pertinent
  given the likelihood that the government will seek broad and highly flexible powers
  to ‘repeal, amend and improve’ EU-related law in the proposed Great Repeal Bill,
  and the possibility that Parliament will seek to hem these powers in by means of
  a strengthened scrutiny procedure akin to what it did with the Public Bodies Act.\n
  \nThe ‘bonfire of the quangos’ legislation should act as a warning of the consequences
  of such an approach. Given the scale and importance of the legislative task now
  facing Parliament as a result of the vote to leave the EU, both the Government and
  Parliament can ill-afford to put forward and approve another new strengthened scrutiny
  process that wastes valuable parliamentary time, fails to deliver the government’s
  policy objectives in a timely way and provides an inadequate scrutiny mechanism
  for important policy changes.  \n\nBut neither can MPs or peers afford to hand over
  a blank cheque for ministers to legislate with limited oversight by Parliament.
  While the strengthened scrutiny procedure may not meet the speed and flexibility
  needs of the Brexit legislative overhaul, the only alternatives are the less stringent
  processes afforded to powers subject to the negative or affirmative scrutiny procedures,
  both of which generally favour the executive. \n\nWe have [previously argued](http://blog.hansardsociety.org.uk/will-the-great-repeal-bill-be-another-abolition-of-parliament-bill/)
  that, given the scale and complexity of the legislative demands that Brexit will
  impose, a fresh look at the delegated legislation system is needed. In the coming
  weeks we will be publishing our proposals for a new model of delegated legislation
  scrutiny in the House of Commons, combining the rigour and robustness of the strengthened
  scrutiny procedure with the speed and flexibility of the negative and affirmative
  procedures. \n\n[^1]: *Sometimes also referred to as framework or skeleton legislation.
