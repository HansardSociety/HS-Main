:title: Westminster Lens
:slug: westminster-lens
:introduction: This data project enhances the provision of information and analysis
  about the scrutiny of primary and secondary legislation by the Westminster Parliament.
  It draws on our unique Statutory Instrument Tracker as well as Parliament's own
  legislative data.
:copy: "## Why we are doing it\n\nThis project, based on new legislative data collected
  since the start of the 2015-16 parliamentary session, seeks to plug the statistical
  hole in our understanding of both the primary and secondary legislative processes.
  It builds on our earlier work in this area, most notably, *[Making Better Law][1]*
  which analyses the political, procedural and cultural factors that together help
  determine the quality of the UK statute book, and *[The Devil is in the Detail:
  Parliament and Delegated Legislation][2]* which laid bare the complexity, weaknesses,
  and contradictions in the scrutiny of delegated legislation in the first comprehensive
  study of this process in decades. \n\nSuccessive governments over the last decade
  have resisted the case for significant reform of the legislative process, particularly
  in relation to delegated legislation.\n\nBy augmenting our qualitative case studies
  with quantitative analysis of the process and procedures we hope to drive a new
  evidence based debate about how government produces and Parliament scrutinises legislation.
  Over time, as the data reveals trends or changes, the research will bring problems
  or new developments in the process into sharper focus, and shed new light on the
  adequacy and effectiveness of the legislative scrutiny process. \n\n## What we are
  doing\n\nSince the beginning of the 2015-16 parliamentary session we have produced
  a weekly subscription based Statutory Instrument Tracker, responding to a need identified
  in our research for improved knowledge and access to the delegated legislation process
  by people outside Parliament. This monitoring provides the Society with a rich seam
  of data touching upon key aspects of the process â€“ such as the number of Henry VIII
  powers, the use of parliamentary time, and breaches of procedural rules - that is
  not currently available elsewhere.  \n\nIn addition to our own data, we have also
  sought to add value to existing data provided in the House of Commons Sessional
  Returns, the House of Lords Sessional Statistics and the reports of the House of
  Lords Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee. These provide statistical evidence
  but rarely set it in context, provide comparison with other sessions, or analyse
  it in the context of the procedural and political arguments being made about the
  legislative process. \n\nThe first Westminster Lens report focuses on the delegated
  legislation process. We will be updating and publishing the statistics after the
  end of each parliamentary session and over time we will expand it to cover key areas
  of the primary legislative process as well.\n\n\n[1]: https://www.hansardsociety.org.uk/publications/making-better-law-reform-of-the-legislative-process-from-policy-to-act\n[2]:
