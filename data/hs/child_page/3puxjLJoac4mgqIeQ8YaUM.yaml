:title: "'Can-Do' Rather Than 'Yah Boo' - Will Theresa May Change the Practice of
  Politics?"
:slug: can-do-rather-than-yah-boo-will-theresa-may-change-the-practice-of-politics
:introduction: Having served as Home Secretary since 2010, Theresa May has been understandably
  silent on a number of key issues beyond her departmental remit.
:copy: "But as she takes over as Prime Minister this week, and following the fallout
  from the EU referendum, an interesting early question is what, if anything, will
  her leadership mean for the culture and practice of politics?\n\nWe have to go back
  some time to unearth her thoughts but as party chair and shadow leader of the House
  of Commons she focused on issues of constitutional and parliamentary reform. One
  key speech she gave was our 2003 Hansard Society annual lecture on the theme ‘*Reconnecting
  Parliament with the People*’. We’ve reproduced the lecture below. \n\nSome of the
  content is of course out of date – some things she suggested have been implemented,
  and the agenda of parliamentary reform has moved on. But much of the speech remains
  relevant today. \n\nShe identified three key problems eroding public faith in Parliament:
  excessive partisanship, the unrepresentative nature of the political class, and
  the prevalence of cronyism. And her recommendations raise interesting questions
  for what approach she might take to the conduct of politics in the future.\n\nPerhaps
  most controversially she suggested lessening the power of the Whips and more free
  votes. Is that a view she would be willing to sign up to now as Prime Minister?
  \n\nShe also focused on need to improve the level of political debate – highly topical
  in light of the appalling standard of debate during the EU referendum campaign.
  Indeed, in the lecture she was highly critical of the standard of debate on Europe
  at that time, and recent events show little has improved since. \n\nShe pointed
  to the way in which excessive partisanship encourages MPs to shout at each other
  in the chamber, encourages campaigning that more resembles a marketing exercise
  in which speeches are little more than pre-prepared party sound bites, and ‘generally
  behave in a way that people outside politics would never dream of doing.’\n\nAs
  someone who has been chosen in part because of her perceived competence, her attention
  to detail, her lack of a circle of political cronies, and for being the grown up
  in the room who focuses on actually doing things rather than merely talking about
  them, her line that ‘voters do not want yah-boo politics. They want can-do politics’
  has particular resonance. \n\nAn interesting early question will be whether her
  style at the despatch box will tone down those features of PMQs that the public
  dislike so much: the shouting, the excessive party-point scoring, and the childish
  behavior. \n\nIn the tone of her remarks one can also find an echo of her speech
  at the launch of her campaign earlier this week in Birmingham and then following
  her confirmation as party leader outside the House of Commons: the need for ambition
  and confidence in the country; the need to address false and extreme divisions within
  politics; social and economic justice; and the need for politicians to earn not
  just command respect. \n\nIn 2003 she called for a new political settlement. Following
  the EU referendum that need is as great as ever. Only time will tell whether Theresa
  May – the can-do rather than yah boo leader – can deliver. \n\n## Reconnecting Parliament
  with the people\n\n### Hansard Society Annual Lecture – Thursday 26 June 2003\n\nI'm
  very grateful to the Hansard Society for inviting me to deliver its fourth annual
  lecture.\n\nI'm pleased also to be following in the footsteps - I'll resist the
  urge to say standing in the shoes - of Robin Cook, a distinguished parliamentarian
  and a long-serving member of the House.\n\nI strongly disagreed with Robin over
  his stance on Iraq, but I respect his decision to give up his Cabinet post because
  of his beliefs…\n\n…And I have to say, it makes a change to watch such an effective
  political operator focusing on his own government from the back-benches, rather
  than on the opposition from the front-bench.\n\nI looked back at the task Robin
  set himself in last year's lecture and considered his legacy as Leader of the House.\n\nClearly,
  the greatest disappointment is the stalling of real reform of the House of Lords.
  We have made no progress over the past year and indeed the whole issue seems to
  have been put on the back burner. The Conservative Party still stands ready to work
  with the Government to secure a lasting solution to this problem and to deliver
  a strengthened Parliament overall.\n\nI notice also that there was little mention
  in Robin's lecture of the Government's plans for the future of the Lord Chancellor
  and their effect on the House of Lords. It was quite a surprise to have these announced
  by press release one Thursday afternoon - not just for me, but also it seems for
  most people in the Government itself.\n\nIt's a great shame that the Prime Minister
  felt unable to apologise to Parliamentarians and to the public for the way that
  the entire fiasco was handled, with no consultation and seemingly no thought. It
  is, I fear, the hallmark of a man who has little but contempt for Parliament and
  by implication for the people themselves.\n\nBut Robin Cook is certainly a House
  of Commons man, and some of the reforms he set out last year have indeed been put
  in place. The House of Commons now has new sitting hours; the process of appointing
  select committees has been changed; questions are now more topical and more effective.\n\nIt
  is probably too early to give a full assessment of the benefits of these reforms,
  but I'm certain that his actions have ensured that Parliament will never be allowed
  to return to how it was when I joined the House in 1997.\n\nYet I have always felt
  that the process of reconnecting Parliament with the people must go much wider than
  simply changing sitting hours and seemingly odd procedures.\n\nTo highlight the
  ways in which people are turned off Parliament, proponents of parliamentary reform
  have often pointed to strange customs such as the wearing of a collapsible opera
  hat by an MP when they wanted to raise a point of order during a division.\n\nBut
  this is to assume that anyone at all knew that this took place. Of course it was
  an odd tradition, but it was hardly one of the main reasons why people fail to take
  parliament seriously. Anyone who sat at home watching the House of Commons on their
  TV would have to be a serious political animal in the first place.\n\nI'm pleased
  that practices like that have gone, but let's be honest: does anyone feel more connected
  to parliament now as a result of any of this Government's reforms than they did
  before?\n\nI suspect the answer is no. We need to look at a wider problem.\n\nI
  would therefore like to talk about two things in particular tonight.\n\nFirstly,
  what procedural or substantive changes could we make to the House of Commons to
  bring it closer to the people?\n\nSecondly, what changes must we make to the level
  of political debate in this country to encourage people to take an interest again?\n\n##
  Parliament and the people\n\nLet me take the first of those points.\n\nAs I've said,
  the reforms so far under this Government have often been cosmetic rather than substantive.
  I believe we need to be far more radical in some of the things we do.\n\nConservatives
  are too often portrayed as simply being resistant to change. This is not so. We
  simply believe that the benefits of change should be clear. We do not believe in
  change simply for change's sake.\n\nIt is in this spirit that as long ago as December
  2001 we set out our principles for reform of the House of Commons.\n\n- We wish
  to see a strengthening of the role, status and powers of Parliament in general,
  and of the House of Commons in particular.\n- We wish to see debates and questions
  in the Commons become more topical and more relevant to the majority of people in
  the United Kingdom.\n- We believe that it is essential to enhance the ability of
  the House of Commons, and especially its Select Committees, to scrutinise the actions
  and decisions of Government.\n- We seek an enhancement in the role and influence
  of backbenchers on all sides, and a greater recognition of the important role performed
  by Opposition parties of whatever political colour at any given time.\n- And finally,
  our approach towards changing the procedures of Parliament is guided by this simple
  test - will such changes increase or diminish the ability of the legislature to
  hold the executive to account?\n\nWith these principles in mind we were able to
  suggest and support some proposals to increase the topicality of parliamentary business,
  strengthen the powers of select committees (particularly with regard to the scrutiny
  of legislation) and ensure adequate time is put aside to debate primary and secondary
  legislation.\n\nSome of these proposals have since taken effect. We hope to see
  others coming into effect sooner rather than later.\n\nBut important as these things
  are, if we're honest I think the three things that erode the public's faith in parliament
  specifically and in politics in general are excessive partisanship, a feeling that
  politicians are not like them and a belief that they are only in it for themselves
  and their friends - in other words, the prevalence of cronyism.\n\nTo take the last
  point first, we live in an era where more and more key decisions about people's
  lives are taken by un-elected bureaucrats and officials rather than elected politicians.\n\nWe
  have a Monetary Policy Committee, a Strategic Rail Authority and a Food Standards
  Agency. Recently when a critical report about the NHS was published by the Audit
  Commission, the NHS Chief Executive - Sir Nigel Crisp - was rolled out to put the
  Government's case.\n\nThese organisations and individuals are anonymous to many
  people, but they wield tremendous influence.\n\nMany members of the public only
  hear about the people running these agencies and Quangos when they hit the headlines
  for doing something wrong.\n\nIt's about time we introduced some form of democracy
  and accountability to this system.\n\nIn the US, they have done just that. Senior
  appointments to key bodies in the United States have to be confirmed by a Senate
  Committee - and only after the individuals concerned have been interviewed and investigated
  by that committee.\n\nI believe a similar system could work here in the UK and would
  go some way to alleviating people's fears about the creep of cronyism throughout
  our system of government.\n\nPeople such as the heads of the Food Standards Agency
  and the Strategic Rail Authority together with people such as the NHS Chief Executive
  should appear before the relevant Select Committee of Parliament to answer its questions
  before their appointment is confirmed - and if the majority on the committee votes
  against the appointment it should not be made.\n\nNot only would this bring some
  democracy to the process, it would also strengthen the role of Select Committees.\n\nSimilarly,
  Michael Howard has argued that members of the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank
  of England - together with the Governor and Deputy Governor - should be vetted by
  a joint committee of both Houses of Parliament to bolster their independence, make
  the process more transparent and increase the power of Parliament.\n\nPolitics also
  has a problem with representation. Parliament should reflect the country it serves
  - yet few would argue it achieves this in its current form.\n\nAll political parties
  have a responsibility to do what they can to attract candidates from all walks of
  British society. This doesn't simply mean more women and members of the Black and
  Minority Ethnic communities as is often argued. It also means getting more people
  from different professions with different skills and talents to come forward and
  stand for election to Parliament.\n\nFor those of us charged with this responsibility
  there are two possible approaches: you can impose rigid structures from the top,
  or you can give people on the ground the choice of how they address the problem.\n\nThe
  Labour Party tried the first approach. Their all-women shortlists programme achieved
  temporary success but it has not been sustained.\n\nI believe that in order to achieve
  long-term progress in this area we must work with local people and local parties
  and give them choice about how they deal with the problem.\n\nCentrally we have
  already made great strides. We have made the way we choose people for our candidates
  list more professional by employing assessment techniques from the world of business.
  We engaged the services of an occupational psychologist to put in place a rigorous
  selection procedure using cutting-edge assessment techniques.\n\nWe now have to
  match these important changes to our national procedures with equally innovative
  changes at a local level.\n\nAnd to do this we are offering our associations the
  opportunity to pilot a series of new ideas to give local people a greater say in
  the selection of their local Conservative candidate.\n\nFor example, in constituencies
  that have not yet selected their candidate and do not have a sitting MP we are offering
  the option of experimenting with US-style primaries. Under this plan, every registered
  Conservative voter in the constituency - or even all electors regardless of political
  affiliation - would have the opportunity to choose the candidate they want from
  a shortlist drawn up by the constituency party.\n\nWe are also inviting associations
  to open selection committees up to non-party members. There could be huge value
  in including prominent local people such as chairmen of residents associations on
  these committees.\n\nWe could expand the scope of the traditional selection process
  by allowing people to vote for their preferred candidate by post, rather than requiring
  them to turn up at the Special General Meeting.\n\nAnd we could look at the selection
  process itself and enhance the usual series of interviews with competency-based
  exercises to assess the best candidates.\n\nFundamentally this is about choice:
  choice for constituency associations who want to try different ways of selecting
  candidates, and choice for local people who will receive a greater say in selecting
  their local candidate.\n\nHopefully, some or all of these innovations will help
  us to match candidates with an appropriate constituency as well as encouraging more
  local people to take an interest in the politics in their area. They are a way of
  re-engaging people with politics, and we hope also that out of them we will see
  more representative candidates coming forward.\n\nIn addition, we're working closely
  with Simon Woolley and his team at Operation Black Vote to encourage greater involvement
  in both local and national politics among members of the Black and Minority Ethnic
  communities.\n\n## But how to deal with the other point - the excessive partisanship?\n\nThis
  is naturally more difficult. Politics is and always will be tribal. There is a reason
  I am Chairman of the Conservative Party and not of one of the other parties. It's
  because of who I am and what I believe.\n\nBut as well as being the Party Chairman
  I'm also the MP for Maidenhead, and I was elected to serve all the people of my
  constituency, whoever they are and however they voted. I am their representative
  at Westminster. They rightly want to know where I stand and what I think.\n\nYet
  Westminster politics is run on a tightly controlled whipping system. Most votes
  are directed by the party whips. You see MPs wandering into the chamber when the
  division bells go, asking which way they should walk and duly obliging, sometimes
  without even knowing much about what they are voting on.\n\nWe have all done it,
  but let me take a recent example. It is, I'm afraid, a partisan example, but I choose
  it simply because it is recent.\n\nTwo weeks ago, we used one of our opposition
  day debates to raise an important issue - that of post office closures. The motion
  we chose to debate used exactly the same wording as an Early Day Motion which had
  been signed by 175 Labour MPs. But when it came to the vote at the end of the debate,
  126 of those Labour MPs voted with the Government against our motion.\n\nIt was
  not a vote that was going to change the world, yet they were simply unable to defy
  the whips and to vote in favour of something they had already supported.\n\nIn any
  other walk of life this would be considered very odd indeed.\n\nAnd this strict
  approach leads to partisanship. It encourages MPs to take sides, shout at each other
  across the chamber and the despatch box, deliver speeches that are little more than
  a collection of sound-bites and party lines, and generally behave in a way that
  people outside politics would never dream of doing.\n\nVoters do not want yah-boo
  politics. They want can-do politics.\n\nSo I've managed to escape the whip tonight
  to suggest something dangerously radical - wouldn't it be good if we could find
  a way to lessen the power of the whips' office and to allow more votes to take place
  on a free vote basis?\n\nI'm not proposing that this is anything that's going to
  happen soon and of course the system remains valuable when it comes to allowing
  Government's to meet their manifesto commitments and get things done, but I would
  like to see a system evolving where at other times MPs have more opportunity to
  speak their minds and to represent their constituents better.\n\nThere is certainly
  a desire for this among the public. The presence of independent MPs in the House
  of Commons may be minimal at the moment, but I believe the coming years will see
  more and more single issue or independent candidates standing in elections.\n\nThe
  lesson for political parties must be to allow their MPs to act as human beings more
  often, rather than continually asking them to obey religiously a party instruction
  with which they may disagree or which may run counter to the interests of their
  individual constituency.\n\n## A new politics\n\nAnd this leads on to my second
  point: the need to raise the general level of political debate.\n\nMost of the things
  I've mentioned so far relate to parliament and the need to change conventions and
  procedures. But by themselves they will not be enough to reverse the decline in
  political participation in this country.\n\nI won't go so far as to claim we are
  facing a crisis of democracy, but when more people are interested in voting in Big
  Brother than in parliamentary or local elections we have to ask ourselves the serious
  question of what's gone wrong.\n\nIt's a familiar fact that the national turnout
  at the last general election was just 59%, but the really worrying statistic is
  that 61% of people aged between 18 and 24 chose not to cast a vote.\n\nThat is,
  of course, their choice - and I do not agree with those, such as the new Leader
  of the Commons, who argue for compulsory voting here in the UK.\n\n## But why did
  they make this choice?\n\nThe instinctive answer is to say that young people just
  aren't interested in politics. But I believe this is too simplistic a view.\n\nLook
  at the number of young people who marched through London and other UK cities to
  protest about the war in Iraq. Consider how many young people took part in similar
  demonstrations to protest about the problems in the countryside or the government's
  policy on tuition fees. Think about the fact that the number of students enrolling
  for politics degrees last year was the highest on record.\n\nThese examples show
  us that young people are not apathetic towards politics, but they are concerned
  that the traditional system of party politics fails to get things done.\n\nAnd I
  believe the reason for this is that we have failed to recognise or acknowledge the
  new nature of politics in the 21st century. These days people - particularly young
  people - are encouraged to question things more and more, and not to simply take
  things at face value.\n\nThey're used to questioning those in authority, rather
  than taking what they say on trust. We no longer live in an age of deference as
  we once did. Instead, we live in an age of reference - reference to one's peers
  but not to those in authority.\n\nNor is politics any longer a game played along
  strict ideological lines. Very few people these days choose their favoured party
  and stick with it for life. People who are more accustomed to making choices in
  their daily lives are also more discerning about politics.\n\nElections become even
  more competitive than before when every vote is up for grabs. And the electorate
  themselves demand more from the political parties. They want to know what positive
  benefit the parties will bring to them personally, but they also want to know that
  the party they choose has a vision for society as a whole. It's not all about self-interest.\n\nThe
  implications of this for my party have been severe. We came to be seen as self-interested,
  and towards the end of our term in office many people who voted for us felt that
  they could do so only as long as no one else knew about it.\n\nBecause our vision
  and our focus became too narrow, people felt that voting for us would tar them with
  the same brush. They felt uneasy about it and as a result they left us in droves.\n\nWe've
  been working on broadening our approach again. To do this, we are trying to break
  out of the confines of the British political system.\n\nFor too long, voters in
  this country have been faced with false choices and artificial divides. On the one
  side of British politics you have the Conservative Party - pro-business, good on
  the economy, strong on law and order. On the other you have the Labour Party - supportive
  of the workers and committed to health and education.\n\nVoters are asked to line
  themselves up on one side of the debate or another - the implication being that
  you can't possibly agree with both.\n\nWhile the current Government managed to bridge
  this gap when they were in opposition before 1997 the artificial divides have returned
  since.\n\nToday we are told that you either want to improve public services or you
  can oppose ever-higher taxes - as if money alone were the answer to every problem
  in our public services, higher taxes were the only possible source of funding, and
  every penny already raised in taxes was spent as effectively as it could be.\n\nYou
  are either a party that wants to help vulnerable communities or you are a party
  that wants to help businesses and encourage enterprise - as if vulnerable people
  are helped when the country as a whole is made poorer.\n\nOn crime, you can either
  take the side of the victim or you can protect historic legal freedoms and deal
  with long-term trends in offending - as if you achieve justice by removing defendants'
  rights from the courts system and offer no help to young offenders who've lost their
  way.\n\nIt is time to change this sterile debate. The challenge of politics today
  is to recognise that prosperity and public services are partners, not opposites.
  That wealth and opportunity can be extended across society, not just to the few.
  And that a neighbourly society is a realistic vision for improving life in Britain's
  most deprived communities.\n\nIt's little wonder people are turned off politics
  when the level of political discussion today displays such an astounding lack of
  ambition and lack of confidence in our country. And it is also a sad caricature
  of our political parties.\n\nI don't believe any of the main parties do not have
  the best interests of the whole country at heart. I don't think their intentions
  are wrong. On the whole, I think politicians of all parties are good people who
  are in politics to make people's lives better.\n\nOf course I disagree with many
  of the methods and policies of the other parties - sometimes strongly - but I rarely
  think they are motivated by anything other than the desire to do some good.\n\nSo
  these false and extreme divisions we create in British politics let down the people
  of this country who look to their politicians to take on the challenges of the day
  and to overcome them.\n\nIf we are to genuinely reconnect people with politics and
  to rebuild their faith in parliament we have to seek a new political settlement
  - one which looks above these exaggerated and extreme opposites and delivers what
  the public wants:\n\nA Britain built on the principles of social justice with better
  public services, and a strong and thriving economy.\n\nThere is no contradiction
  here. There is only a lack of political ambition and a resultant caricature of British
  politics leading to a sterile debate that simply turns people off.\n\n## Who do
  we blame for this?\n\nThe traditional target for politicians is the media and certainly
  they are not entirely blameless. Too often, they focus on personalities at the expense
  of policies. They look for sound-bites and catchy headlines. It's not easy to change
  the nature of political debate when newspapers and broadcasters are prepared to
  repeat - without questioning - scare stories about '20% cuts across the board' whenever
  someone tries to challenge the conventional thinking on the funding of public services.\n\nA
  few months ago we had an American intern working with us at Central Office. At the
  end of her stay she was asked what the main difference was between British and American
  politics, and she said the press. 'In the US they report things, here they always
  try to interpret them'.\n\nPoliticians know that everything they say and do will
  not just be reported, but interpreted. And as a result a politician's greatest fear
  is going 'off-message'. That's why many political interviews these days take the
  form of an overly-aggressive interviewer demanding answers from an overly-defensive
  politician. Both participants know that any deviation from the party line - any
  slight difference in nuance - will be treated as a gaffe or the worst party split
  since the last one.\n\nThe columnist Matthew Parris summed this up when he wrote:\n\n\"If
  I could remove from the journalists' lexicon a single word, and with it remove the
  moronism to which it gives throat, that word would be \"gaffe\". Like a flock of
  demented parrots we shriek \"gaffe! gaffe! gaffe!\" whenever anyone in public life
  says anything interesting. What others would call speaking out, we call speaking
  out of turn. The voicing of unpalatable truth, we call indiscretion. Taking a flyer,
  we call dropping a brick. We peck to pieces any politician who breaks cover and
  speaks his mind. Soon only grey heads tucked below parapets and mouthing platitudes
  remain. Then the media parrots chorus \"boring! boring\" (The Times, 30 November
  2002).\n\nMore recently, another Times columnist, Danny Finkelstein, described how
  an 'elaborate set of rules' has grown up, determining how the political game is
  played. But he added that while: 'The public has largely grown tired of the rules…politicians
  and the media have not' (The Times, 3 June 2003).\n\nBut you know politics is not
  a game - and many members of the press would do well to note that many people no
  longer read national newspapers or watch national news broadcasts. Research shows
  that 84 per cent of adults regularly read a regional or local newspaper, but 40
  per cent of all adults who read a regional publication do not read a national paper
  - and if they do they no longer always believe them.\n\nBut tempting though it is,
  I don't want to blame the media entirely. The real problem lies with the politicians
  themselves.\n\nAs I said earlier, politics is by nature tribal and this is never
  clearer than during a general election campaign, the point of which is to help people
  decide who they would prefer to run the country for the next five years. Here, amplifying
  the differences between parties can help to make that choice clear.\n\nThe problem
  is that modern politics is becoming more and more like one long election campaign.\n\nBefore
  allowing this trend to continue, politicians of all parties should consider the
  dangers it poses. Between elections, the differences that matter to people are not
  necessarily those that exist between the parties but those that exist between how
  things are and how things should be.\n\nThe debate they would like to see is about
  how we can make things better.\n\nNow I certainly believe that Tony Blair's government
  has introduced a range of policies that take us in the wrong direction. Others would
  say the same about policies introduced between 1979 and 1997. But no one in their
  right mind imagines that every problem in our schools or our health service originated
  with the election of one Government or another. Many of these problems are deep-seated
  and have been bubbling beneath the surface for decades. Finding solutions to these
  problems is what politics should be about and that is where the debate should be.\n\nMy
  fear is that the five-year election campaign results in the victory of extreme and
  exaggerated rhetoric over the resolution of big and difficult challenges.\n\nAnd
  sadly this even happens when we're dealing with some of the most important issues
  of the day.\n\n## Europe\n\nTake for example the appalling way in which the important
  issues about Europe and the Euro have been treated in recent weeks.\n\nThere is
  little doubt that the European Union and the European Parliament are taking on an
  increasingly important role in the life of this country.\n\nRecently the Convention
  on the Future of Europe published its draft proposals set to form the basis of a
  new European constitution. They plan:\n\n- A President of the European Council.\n-
  Tighter co-operation on foreign policy, including a European Minister for Foreign
  Affairs.\n- A legally binding Charter of Fundamental Rights, and\n- A common asylum
  and immigration policy across the community.\n\nAt around the same time, the Government
  finally announced its decision (or more properly its non-decision) on Britain's
  membership of the European Single Currency, with all the affect that decision has
  on interest rates, home-ownership, employment and UK trade.\n\nIn short, it has
  been an important time in British politics when we have been facing major decisions
  about the future of our country.\n\nAnd yet, far from having the wide-ranging debate
  you would expect - far from setting out the economic, constitutional and political
  implications these issues have for the UK - the Government chose to conflate all
  these points into one single argument: you're either in favour of the European Union
  or you want out of it.\n\nThat's it. No other vision of the EU's future allowed,
  no debate permitted and certainly no consultation with the people.\n\nIf I may be
  forgiven a brief moment of partisanship, this approach is ridiculous, it is cynical
  and it is a travesty of democracy.\n\nRather than engage in a debate about the proposals
  from the European Convention, the Government has chosen to claim - quite alone of
  any of the European governments - that they have no real implications for Britain
  and anyone who questions them must want to withdraw from the EU.\n\nAnd rather than
  discuss the economic impact of the European Single Currency, the Government is seeking
  to portray anyone who does question it as being some sort of little-England isolationist.\n\nThey
  are closing down the debate and instead deliberately creating that false divide
  of which I spoke earlier - you're either part of their version of the pro-European
  consensus or you're a dinosaur who wants to withdraw from the EU entirely and have
  nothing to do with it.\n\nPolitical debate can scarcely get much lower than that,
  when you're prevented from discussing matters of such fundamental importance to
  the future of the country.\n\nIt is emphatically not the policy of the Conservative
  Party to withdraw from the European Union. It is, quite simply, a lie - a scare
  story. Indeed, the only main party leader to ever stand for election on that platform
  is the Prime Minister himself.\n\nWe have to be prepared to have an open and honest
  debate about the future of Europe, recognising that there are many different views
  among the current members and the accession countries.\n\nIf we politicians are
  unable to have that full and frank debate on an issue of this importance it is no
  surprise that people have little faith in us and in the political institutions of
  this country.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAt the end of the day, the task of reconnecting
  parliament with the people is about far more than the day-to-day workings of the
  Palace of Westminster.\n\nParliament is not simply a building or even the conventions
  and traditions within the building - it is its members, the 659 MPs and the members
  of the House of Lords.\n\nFor the people of Britain, that magnificent gothic looking
  building on the banks of the Thames is the repository of political power in this
  country, and people will only feel any connection with it if they feel part of the
  entire political process.\n\nIf they feel politicians are like them, grown-up people
  with their own views and opinions who are serious about making a difference. If
  they think politicians are people who are prepared to consult them and listen to
  their views. If they think politicians trust them and are worthy of their trust
  in return.\n\nWe no longer command respect simply because of who we are. In this
  day and age respect is something that has to be earned.\n\nIf we can rise to that
  challenge and appear to be people who are prepared to put our ambition for our country
  ahead of our personal party prejudices then we just might encourage people to be
  proud of their politicians and their Parliament once again.\n\nEnds"
