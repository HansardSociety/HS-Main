:title: In a close contest, will money make a difference?
:slug: in-a-close-contest-will-money-make-a-difference
:introduction: In the run-up to any election, attention often turns to party finance.
  In the US, for example, coverage of Presidential campaigns often refers to how much
  candidates have raised. In Britain, the sums involved are far lower.
:copy: "This is partly because of a tremendously far-sighted decision at the birth
  of commercial television to not permit party advertising on broadcast media, and
  partly because since 2001, the amounts that can be spent by national parties on
  elections have been capped following the implementation of the Political Parties,
  Elections and Referendums Act 2000.\n\nIndeed, since 2001, the permitted level of
  campaign expenditure has become even lower in real terms. The limit is calculated
  at a rate of £30,000 per constituency contested. For the major parties contesting
  all of the seats in Britain in 2015 the spending limit will therefore be just shy
  of £19 million (as it was in 2010). But the figure of £30,000 per constituency has
  never been adjusted for inflation, so the amount the parties are allowed to spend
  in real terms is steadily falling: £19 million will buy around a third less in 2015
  than it did in 2000; in real terms it equates to around £13 million at 2000 prices.
  Over time, elections are costing less.\n\nOf course, while election spending is
  limited, that does not imply that all parties spend up to the limit. In 2010, Labour
  managed to spend only around £8 million, while the Liberal Democrats have never
  been able to spend anything like even that low total – they spent £4.8 million in
  2010. Even the comparatively wealthy Conservatives spent quite a bit less than the
  permitted maximum: £16.7 million. That Conservative financial advantage was driven
  by the ‘return to the norm’ in the years before 2010, when the Conservatives resumed
  their mantle as the wealthy party – a position that had been interrupted by Tony
  Blair’s stewardship of the Labour Party. Since 2010, however, there are signs that
  this may again be changing. Up to and including the latest available accounts ending
  in 2013, Labour has attracted more income. As Figure 1 below shows, Conservative
  income after 2010 dropped off fairly sharply and though Labour’s income has been
  swelled by the receipt of public funds (Short money) by virtue of being in opposition,
  their income has still exceeded that of the Conservatives since 2010. However, declared
  donations to the central parties (donations in excess of £7.5k) during 2014 suggest
  that the Conservatives may be better placed financially come the election. Over
  the first three quarters of this year, the Conservatives have received £18.2 million
  against Labour’s £12.6 million (including Short money) and the Liberal Democrats’
  £3.8 million.\n\n<figure>\n\t    <figcaption>Figure 1</figcaption>\n![Central party
  income 1989-2013 (at 2003 prices)](/content/images/2015/04/graph_central-party-income.png)\n</figure>\n\nOther
  indicators also suggest that the 2015 election may see parties spending closer to
  the permitted maximum. A previous trend for parties is that they have often spent
  much more than their income in any one year. Over the last eight years, however,
  that particular habit has been broken. Both Labour and the Conservatives have generally
  been able to contain their spending, and while the reverse has been true for the
  Liberal Democrats, the latest accounts (2013) indicate that they too have been able
  to spend less than they’ve generated (Figure 2). The result for the largest two
  parties is that their liabilities have fallen sharply.\n\n<figure>\n\t    <figcaption>Figure

  if nothing else, 2015 looks like it will be a more even spending contest between
  Labour and the Conservatives. The Liberal Democrats as usual will have far less
  financial muscle. But will this lead to electoral payoffs? The evidence, here, is
  decidedly mixed. At national level, there is very little evidence that increased
  spending by parties gives them a significant financial advantage. In part, that
  is a function of the growing electoral importance of constituency level campaigning,
  on which all parties pay increasing attention – especially in their target seats.\n\nElection
  expenditure at constituency level is assigned to the candidate rather than the party
  during the regulated campaign period. And, there is consistent evidence over time
  that candidates who spend more tend to perform better electorally, particularly
  when they are challengers. In 2010, had Conservative candidates spent the maximum
  possible in every seat and both Labour and Liberal Democrat spent very little, the
  Conservatives would have won an estimated 344 seats, enough for a working Commons
  majority. A similar scenario where Labour candidates spent the maximum and other
  parties mounted minimal campaigns would have produced an estimated 282 seats for
  Labour. However, what candidate spending fails to capture is voluntary effort, the
  labour provided for free by party activists and supporters. When this is factored
  in, the positive electoral effects of higher spending can be offset by the free
  campaigning delivered by those activists. Thus, despite the Conservatives candidates’
  significant financial advantage in 2010, both Labour and Liberal Democrat candidates
  were able to counter this through their voluntary efforts, supplied for free. Had
  Labour campaigns engaged in the highest levels of free campaigning (as undertaken
  in their most intense campaigns) in every seat (with Conservative and Liberal Democrat
  campaigns being minimal), Labour would have won an estimated 350 seats (see [You
  Get What You (don’t) Pay for: The Impact of Volunteer Labour and Candidate Spending
  at the 2010 British General Election](http://pa.oxfordjournals.org/content/67/4/804.abstract)).
  In other words, the effects of free campaigns sometimes can be greater than those
  based on money.\n\nSo, 2015 looks like it may be a more even contest than 2010 in
  terms of party spending – at least for the two largest parties. And, given the closeness
  of the election, we can probably anticipate a great deal of campaigning, both at
  national and constituency levels. That’s a good thing. More intense campaigning
  (which, of course, costs money) has a demonstrably beneficial effect on turnout.
  But, we should also remember that the amount parties can spend on elections is decreasing
  in real terms year-on-year. That may need to be addressed if the beneficial effects
  of campaigning on turnout and voter education are to continue. Equally though, we
  should also remember that voters tend to respond positively to the human touch,
  which is frequently provided for free.\n\n---\n\n**Image Courtesy**: [Philip Taylor](https://flic.kr/p/bDwJ11),
