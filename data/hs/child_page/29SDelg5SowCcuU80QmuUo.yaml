:title: Digital didn't win it, but it did shape the campaign
:slug: digital-didnt-win-it-but-it-did-shape-the-campaign
:introduction: Labour got the most mentions, but how many of those were positive?
  And UKIP were ahead of the Conservatives on tweets but it didn’t turn into seats.
  Social media rumbled on throughout the campaign, largely an echo chamber, not a
  place for debate.
:copy: "There were clear traffic peaks and an expected build as polling day approached.
  However, the peaks were more likely to be milestone moments – leaders’ debates,
  dissolution of the house and manifesto launches - and it was really only the row
  over ‘non-dom’ status that interested social media early on, before the frenzy of
  the last few days. Cameron might have stood out in terms of mentions for leaders,
  but again it’s difficult to tell how many of these were positive or negative without
  deeper analysis. Harder still to work out what if any impact these were having on
  the hearts and minds of voters. \n\nSocial media didn’t make this election but neither
  was it a passive bystander. The increasingly normative nature of social tools means
  that it is a natural outlet for expression. One of many perhaps, but a visible and
  often more public one. According to Demos, the [#GE2015 hashtag was mentioned over
  265,000 times](http://www.demos.co.uk/blog/demos-election-blog) by 9pm on polling
  day. It also looks from the Demos data that the tweeters were disproportionately
  men (59%, to 40% women).\n\nThere were no really catastrophic social media moments,
  nothing more than the occasional rogue Ukipper: perhaps the image of Emily Thornberry’s
  ‘White van in Rochester’ was still too fresh in politicians’ minds? There were a
  few obvious fails though, perhaps the best being the Conservative’s pre-programmed
  “strong and commanding performance” message from the leaders’ Question Time programme.
  This was parroted out to the world almost verbatim by a sorry troupe of Tories who
  clearly didn’t know how social media worked. They weren’t unique, the two big parties
  and most candidates used social media as a battering ram of pre-prepared pronouncements,
  videos - which they vainly hoped would somehow go viral; they didn’t - and a range
  of choreographed attacks on the opposition. Though there was the odd gem, take the
  UKIP supporter who used Twitter to hark back to the glory days of ‘old England’
  after watching Lord of the Rings. Do you want to tell him, or should I? And of course
  we got #Millifandom, though it wasn’t enough to change the result, and the #Cameronettes,
  which turned out to have been staged. More depressing and perhaps more predictable,
  [Millicent Scott, the LibDem candidate for Hammersmith](http://www.getwestlondon.co.uk/news/west-london-news/hammersmith-lib-dem-election-candidate-9249107),
  tried to engage voters but what she found was a small group of vocal trolls who
  “were just interested in bullying me and it was unpleasant, unnecessary and unappreciated”.\n\nThe
  internet did come into play in a wider sense. Activist groups such as Bite the Ballot
  did a fantastic job of getting people enrolled to vote, particularly on the back
  of a far too recent change to individual voter registration that threatened to keep
  many young people off the electoral roll. Getting over 450,000 people [registered
  online](https://www.gov.uk/performance/register-to-vote) on the very last day was
  a great success too - in previous elections almost all of those people would have
  missed out. We also saw a plethora of vote matching websites spring up, some independent
  and some aligned to media outlets. Overall, these sites are a great way to educate
  people about different parties and what they stand for but caution is needed. One
  seemed determined to tell us to vote Green regardless of what we put in and the
  Daily Telegraph’s ‘Tactical voting guide’ turned out to have been [programmed never
  to tell you to vote SNP](http://www.buzzfeed.com/tomphillips/s-nope-p), even when
  they were the only other party who could win the seat. What this highlights for
  me is that the use of the internet in elections is still relatively new, unregulated
  and too uncritically accepted. In future we should only promote and trust voter
  engagement tools that commit to code transparency and to being fully auditable.
  \n\nSo this wasn’t an internet election in the sense that the internet didn’t change
  the outcome. But perhaps it was a digital election since the tools behind the scenes
  changed the campaign. A lot of the support in the real campaigns going on at constituency
  level were digital-led. Variations on the [NationBuilder](http://nationbuilder.com/)
  platform used by most parties and the Conservative’s in-house Merlin system made
  a difference. In fact you could argue that it was Merlin ‘wot won it’ for the Conservatives,
  or at least the way it was used (since digital is only a tool). That might be a
  bit strong but it certainly had an impact. Their hyper-focus on the marginal voters
  in the marginal seats was a classic adoption of US campaigning techniques. Although
  what you can do in the UK is more limited because of privacy laws, the Tories seem
  to have benefitted in part by focussing on people not profiles, on individual voters
  not demographics.\n\n---\n\n**Image Courtesy**: [Jason Howie](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jasonahowie/),
