:slug: its-brexit-so-what-now-for-parliament

  of the Journals, House of Commons\n\n__Seema Malhotra MP__  \nMember for Feltham
  and Heston\n\n__Professor the Lord Norton of Louth__  \nMember of the House of Lords
  Constitution Committee and Professor of Government and Director of the Centre for
  Legislative Studies, University of Hull\n\n## About\n\nAt this event, involving
  leading parliamentary and constitutional experts, we will be debating the key questions
  now facing Parliament over the next few years:\n\n- What reforms – in the Chamber
  and Committees – might be needed to ensure the scrutiny process is fit for purpose
  to deal with the scale of the challenge ahead?\n- Should there be a move towards
  greater joint working with the House of Lords? What are the pros and cons of this
  approach?\n- Do we need a super-committee, for example modelled on the Banking Commission
  inquiry?\n- Given the volume of legislation and regulation that will need to be
  sorted out, how might this be done most effectively?\n- Does Parliament have sufficient
  capacity and expertise to support MPs and Peers and if not, what might be needed?"
