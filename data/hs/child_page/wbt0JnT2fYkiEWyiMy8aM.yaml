  ### About the Audit of Political Engagement

  The Hansard Society’s Audit of Political Engagement is the only annual health check on British democracy. Now in its 14th year, the study measures the ‘political pulse’ of the nation, providing a unique benchmark to gauge public opinion with regard to politics and the political process. Each Audit report presents the findings from a public opinion poll survey, providing detailed commentary on a range of measures that have been chosen as key indicators of political engagement. These indictors enable us to chronicle responses year-on-year and track the direction and magnitude of change since the Audit was first published in 2004.
  The Audit of Political Engagement is supported by the House of Commons.
