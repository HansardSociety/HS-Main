:title: 'Launch of the Audit of Political Engagement 14: the 2017 report'
:slug: launch-of-the-audit-of-political-engagement-14-the-2017-report
:introduction: Join the authors of the 2017 Audit of Political Engagement as they
  present their findings alongside a panel of leading commentators, and explore how
  one of the most consequential acts of democratic decision-making ever seen in this
  country has shaped levels of political engagement across the UK.
:copy: "* As we go into an unexpected general election how politically engaged are
  the British public?\n* Do they feel interested in and knowledgeable about politics?
  Are they more satisfied with our system of governing?\n* Voter turnout in the EU
  referendum was high. Are there any other areas where people’s political behaviour
  is changing?\n* Beyond voter turnout, has there been a positive 'referendum effect'
  on public attitudes to politics and Parliament of the kind witnessed after the Scottish
  independence referendum in 2014?\n* And in just a few weeks we will be electing
  650 MP's to Parliament - but what do the British public want from our MP's, and
  how well do they think Parliament has carried out its core functions in recent years?\n\n*This
  event is free to attend. Teas, coffee and light refreshments will be served from
  8:45am.*\n\n## Speakers\n\n__Tim Bale__  \nProfessor of Politics, Queen Mary, University

  Audit of Political Engagement is the only annual health check on British democracy.
  Now in its 14th year, the study measures the ‘political pulse’ of the nation, providing
  a unique benchmark to gauge public opinion with regard to politics and the political
  process.\nEach Audit report presents the findings from a public opinion poll survey,
  providing detailed commentary on a range of measures that have been chosen as key
  indicators of political engagement. These indictors enable us to chronicle responses
  year-on-year and track the direction and magnitude of change since the Audit was
  first published in 2004.\n\n*The Audit of Political Engagement is supported by the
  House of Commons.*\n\n![House of Commons logo](https://cdn.evbuc.com/eventlogos/12169895/houseofcommonsoftheunitedkingdom.svg.png)"
