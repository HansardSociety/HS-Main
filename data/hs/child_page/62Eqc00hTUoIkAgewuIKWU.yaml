:title: Why the Edstone failed - in a biblical way
:slug: why-the-edstone-failed-in-a-biblical-way
:introduction: The Edstone is one of the abiding images of the 2015 General Election.
  8ft 6 inches tall and made out of solid limestone, the Edstone was inscribed with
  six pledges from the then Labour leader Ed Miliband.
:copy: "It was a political stunt that instantly backfired. The morning after its erection
  in a car park in Hastings the stone was swiftly removed and disappeared for the
  rest of the election. Only recently it was found by Daily Mail reporters, hidden
  in a warehouse in south London. \n\nFor the media and many in the Labour Party it
  looked like Mr Miliband was acting more like a biblical prophet than a modern, secular
  political leader. \n\nOf course, for most of human history across the world faith
  and politics have been far more obviously interlinked than in the present day. Rulers
  were elected or selected by God and expected to uphold the faith, the universe was
  thick with supernatural beings and temporal political actions were set in a theological
  grand narrative. \n\nAfter the Enlightenment and the slow (continuing) secularisation
  of much of modern life following the industrial revolution it is often assumed that
  faith is disappearing in modern life and modern politics. \n\nWhat this assumption
  often misses is the crucial difference between what we may distinguish as ‘substantive’
  religion (a worldview based on a relationship with supernatural creatures: saints,
  devils and angels) and ‘functional’ religion (how religion satisfies certain personal
  and communal needs: the way religious faith gives our lives in community structure
  and meaning for example.)\n\nThe point is just that when we say ‘religion’ is receding
  in importance we are often only thinking of the substantial aspects of faith. In
  contrast, ‘functional’ faith is going nowhere and in the general election of 2015
  it emerged in some surprising and fascinating forms. \n\nAs Don Cupitt puts in his
  book *Theology’s Strange Return*, our\n\n> ... whole culture remains strangely pervaded
  by religious art, religious language and religious feeling. Even though we know
  that there is not literally any God, nor life after death nor supernatural order,
  nor anything ‘absolute’ and eternal, yet we still remain temperamentally religious
  beings.\n\nThe General Election saw the creation of a variety of functional faiths,
  some more convincing than others.\n\nLabour, under Ed Miliband was perhaps the least
  substantial. The party’s grand narrative (which, in our modern age is the secular
  equivalent to an over-arching theological narrative) was lacking in power and imagination
  – this was made concrete (or rather, limestone) in the Edstone. Although we live
  in a small secular universe compared to that of our ancestors, pledges on ‘Homes
  to buy and action on rents’ hardly sets the soul alight.\n\nPut simply, any grand
  narrative needs to rest on convincing fundamentals. \n\nThe competing conservative
  narrative was better but still not dazzling and, for something more than humdrum,
  we need to look north to Scotland.\n\nThe Edstone was a monumental failure and an
  almighty gaffe for the Labour party. But it wasn’t the first political statement
  quite literally ‘set in stone’ in the past year. That honour goes to [Alex Salmond
  and his own Salmond stone](http://www.scotsman.com/news/education/alex-salmond-free-university-vow-writ-in-stane-1-3608685).
  \n\nIt was mocked by many journalists but, many months later, the stone is still
  there. \n\nSo why did the Edstone fail but the Salmond stone succeed? \n\nThe SNP
  won almost 50% of the vote north of the border and routed all three unionist parties.
  Its followers, compared to the other parties, are brimming with moral purpose, ambition
  and vision. As I have argued elsewhere, their party gatherings [remind one more
  of a mega church](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/david-knowles/snp-membership-numbers_b_6208404.html)
  than a political gathering, [the party has hoovered up the floating believers of
  contemporary Scotland](http://www.thinkscotland.org/thinkpolitics/articles.html?read_full=12808&article=www.thinkscotland.org)
  and [the SNP in anthropological and sociological terms ‘functions religiously.’](http://www.historytoday.com/david-knowles/politics-religious-experience)\n\nAt
  the heart of this functionality of the SNP is their grand narrative of Scotland
  which is arresting, powerful and attractive. Scotland, currently trapped in the
  union, its talents constrained and its potential unrealised could be so much more,
  the SNP argue. The struggle against the British state (understood by some of the
  SNP’s followers as nefarious, all-powerful and cruel) is not just a fight for identity
  (to ‘make Scotland’s voice heard’) but a profound moral struggle as well. To listen
  to some SNP members and supporters talk you realise that many do not just oppose
  the Tories, they hate them with a burning and righteous passion. Love for the nation
  and hatred for its oppressors are powerful emotions. \n\nA vote for the SNP, if
  you follow their rhetoric, is a vote for self-determination and self-realisation.
  But this self is not alone – rather it is within the community of the Scottish nation,
  moving forward as one against the hated Tory enemy. \n\nWhether you agree or disagree,
  support or oppose, the SNP’s grand narrative is hugely more attractive and substantial
  than anything the other parties offer.  \n\nGiven its depth and profundity (the
  notion of the nation state coming closest in the modern world to what ancient theologians
  deemed sacred) it is no surprise that, when marshalled and inspired by talented
  leaders, the SNP has for some started to function religiously. How could it not?
  It provides an answer to some of the most basic questions about life (where are
  we going, who are our enemies, where did we come from? etc.) is an expanding and
  welcoming community and gives clear, simple answers to difficult questions. \n\nThis
  is in stark contrast to Labour. \n\nThe Edstone could never inspire because no one
  was ever sure what it meant. It was created by a leader who failed to articulate
  a convincing narrative of the future not only to his supporters (one Labour staffer
  broke down when he first saw the Edstone on television) but the rest of the country
  as well. \n\nThe lines between faith and politics have always been blurred and human
  beings, no matter how much we secularise our public spaces and interactions will
  never stop behaving in religiously recognisable ways. Important emotions and important
  ideas are always treated with special reverence. Those tuning in to BBC Parliament
  next week for the state opening of Parliament will see this principle first hand.
  \n\nPerhaps the reason Salmond’s stone is still standing and Milibands’ is languishing,
  forgotten and reviled in a draughty warehouse, is simple. Despite its silliness,
  one rested upon a powerful quasi-religious grand narrative, the other pretended
  it did, and was destroyed.\n\n---\n\n**Image Courtesy**: [Fr Lawrence Lew, O.P.](https://www.flickr.com/photos/paullew/),
