:title: Is Parliament Ready for Brexit?
:slug: is-parliament-ready-for-brexit
:introduction: 'After probably the most momentous month in British politics since
  1945, there''s one Leave decision that virtually all MPs and peers seem agreed on,
  and are even looking forward to: Parliament begins its long summer recess on Thursday,
  21 July.'
:copy: "That six-week break will offer time to draw breath and consider how Parliament
  should respond to those recent tumultuous events. As the Deputy Commons Speaker,
  Eleanor Laing, put it at a meeting of the Hansard Society on Monday: \"If Jeffrey
  Archer had presented to his publisher a draft outline of a novel charting the last
  four weeks at Westminster, it would have been rejected as much too far-fetched!\"
  \n\nShe neatly set the scene for a special seminar held after the Society's AGM,
  entitled: *It's Brexit... So what now for Parliament?*\n\nThe task of the seminar
  - held in Parliament's Portcullis House with a packed audience on the first sweltering
  evening of an ephemeral summer - was to ponder with some of Westminster's finest
  constitutional minds just how MPs and peers can play a significant part in shaping
  the Brexit negotiations and the eventual deal these are meant to deliver. \n\nSome
  straws in the wind of change blowing through Westminster came from the passionate
  comments and thoughtful insights expressed at the meeting, which concluded that
  Parliament should have a major role - not only in scrutinising but also in shaping
  how the Brexit negotiations and the eventual deal are constructed:   \n\n- \"How
  should we understand what's happened? Is this divorce? Or is it a trial separation?
  Is it just a big argument? Are we seeing buyers' remorse?\" \n- \"How can Parliament
  play any significant part in assessing how to disentangle the legal complexities
  of four decades of euro-law when it has fewer than 20 lawyers of its own compared
  to the government's 2,000?\"\n- \"We do have a problem because Parliament is not
  an easy beast to manage: it doesn't speak with one voice but we shouldn't be waiting
  for the government to take the initiative.\"\n- \"Once the terms of exit are known,
  it is up to Parliament if it wants to legislate for another referendum. You could
  be asking if you accept the terms negotiated.\" \n- \"We have to leave before the
  2019 euro-elections for new MEPs. If we are putting up candidates for these elections,
  people will take to the streets!\"\n\n**Major problems to be resolved**\n\nNot everyone
  saw the problems thrown up by the referendum's narrow Leave vote in such apocalyptic
  terms as that last prediction from one audience member, but the panellists agreed
  there were major problems to be resolved if Parliament was to play a significant
  part in the process of disentangling the UK from the European Union over the next
  couple of years.  \n\nThe Conservative peer and constitutional historian, Professor
  Philip Norton, said Parliament's consent wasn't required for the government to trigger
  Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, firing the starting gun for the two-year process
  of leaving the EU. That was a matter of international law, he said. But he thought
  it would be \"politically wise\" for ministers to ensure they had parliamentary
  support for the process. Lord Norton said Parliament should have a more pro-active
  role than just reacting to what the government would be doing on the Brexit negotiations.\n\nHe
  backed calls for some kind of joint parliamentary committee of both Houses and argued
  that MPs and peers must be involved in the final stage of what he called the \"heavy
  lifting\" to remove the vast swathes of EU legislation on the Westminster statute
  book… which could occupy a great deal of parliamentary time.  \n\nThe former shadow
  cabinet member, Labour's Seema Malhotra MP, explained why she and her Labour colleague,
  Stephen Kinnock, were calling for a special new parliamentary committee to be set
  up. She said it was still totally unclear what the new Prime Minister, Theresa May,
  actually meant by saying \"Brexit means Brexit\". She was disappointed by the referendum
  result as an active supporter of the Remain campaign, but she stressed the need
  now was for pragmatism and an acceptance of the result. \n\n**Scrutiny role for
  Parliament \"not enough\"**\n\nShe welcomed the setting up of a Brexit government
  department under the newly-appointed David Davis MP, adding that Parliament had
  to be very demanding now, with proper accountable structures set up. Simply having
  a scrutiny role wouldn't be enough, she said, given the scale and complexity of
  all the issues involved. So she envisages a special joint parliamentary committee
  being set up by September when MPs return to Westminster, one that involves both
  Houses...and she suggested that part of its remit should include a clear role for
  opposition parties and to ensure that Remain voices were heard too, along with wide
  consultations outside Parliament as well.\n\nThe Commons' Clerk of the Journals,
  Paul Evans, a highly-experienced adviser on the constitution, questioned Lord Norton's
  suggestion that Parliament had no say in triggering Article 50. If it was being
  suggested this could be done using the government's powers under the Royal Prerogative,
  he begged to differ. He told the meeting: \"The whole history of Parliament is about
  circumscribing the Prerogative. That is what we do. That is our job. We are certainly
  free to do so if Parliament wants to act\".\n\n**Liaison Committee should take the
  lead**\n\nMr Evans bemoaned the fact that Parliament was, in his words, \"not an
  easy beast to manage\", and one that didn't speak with one voice. He said a 'typical'
  continental parliament - faced with this kind of constitutional crisis - would be
  \"getting its act together\" and beginning to negotiate resources and how to proceed.
  In fact, he had learnt from sources that both the French National Assembly and the
  German Bundestag had both begun to set up committees to look at Britain's likely
  EU exit from their own point of view, while Westminster dithered.\n\nHe thought
  the obvious group to lead this high-powered committee required was the Liaison Committee,
  made up of all the chairs of Commons select committees. But it hasn't yet spoken
  out, or expressed any view on how it would coordinate a response. He pointed that
  the new Brexit department under David Davis would have a new select committee to
  scrutinise it but said he would be uncomfortable if that was Parliament's only response.
  Other committees would want to be involved too. All the speakers seemed to agree
  that something along the lines of the wide-ranging Banking Commission, which was
  set up to analyse the causes of the 2009 banking Crash was certainly one possible
  model for how to proceed.\n\nMr Evans also pointed to what he called the deficits
  in the UK Parliament's approach to scrutinising the EU over 40 years. He thought
  Britain's Euro-MPs had never been treated with any great respect.\" We don't even
  give them parliamentary passes,\" he pointed out. Similarly, there were few institutional
  links with the devolved administrations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\n\n**Commons
  and Lords \"not very good\" at sharing resources**\n\nHe underlined concerns that
  Parliament couldn't move as quickly as the government on Brexit, saying that Theresa
  May became Prime Minister on Wednesday, and by Thursday we had a Brexit government
  department and lead minister, and by Friday it had a Permanent Secretary and civil
  servants. Parliament simply couldn't match that. There was as yet no \"Brexit Unit\"
  in the House of Commons. \"We need to share resources between the two Houses, something
  we are not very good at. It is all quite 'make do and mend'. We are very proud of
  our ability to improvise but this may well be a test that provokes Parliament to
  act, so we can achieve a satisfactory result,\" he added.\n\nAnswering questions
  from the packed audience, Lord Norton dismissed continuing concerns about the legitimacy
  of the Leave vote due to the wafer-thin majority of less than 4%. No threshold or
  super-majority had been imposed on the referendum bill when it went through Parliament,
  he pointed out, adding a little ruefully that no MP or peer had suggested imposing
  one… except him! There had been no appetite for it. Now, they couldn't change the
  rules or re-fight the campaign. And while the referendum hadn't actually been binding
  on Parliament, nor was it simply a case of saying \"Tell us what you think, and
  then we'll think about whether we will do anything about it.\" \n\nBut, a major
  part of the Brexit case in the referendum was about returning Britain's parliamentary
  sovereignty and, significantly, Lord Norton joined the other speakers - and now
  the Labour leadership challenger, Owen Smith - in conceding that once the terms
  of any Brexit deal were finally known, it would be an option for Parliament if it
  wanted to legislate for a further referendum on whether those terms were acceptable.\n\n\"You
  could be asking if you accept the terms negotiated. You could offer to come out
  after two years or stay in. What I would beware of is anything that was a re-run.
  Yes, the majority of MPs and peers were for Remain, but we have moved on so there
  is no point in refighting that. Now we have to discuss the process for dealing with
  it. We are where we are\". \n\n**With political will \"UK would return to the fold\"**\n\nCommons
  Clerk Paul Evans put it rather more bluntly and irreverently, waving aside concerns
  that once Article 50 is triggered, any one of the other 27 EU members could veto
  the UK changing its mind and voting to Remain after all. \"If the political will
  was there, the UK would return to the fold. Somehow, we would make it happen. That's
  what politics is about. Law often makes the mistake of thinking it describes reality.
  Article 50 is more about politics than about international law.\"\n\nLabour's Seema
  Malhotra said she was still trying to come to terms with how to understand what
  had happened in the Brexit vote. \"Is this divorce? Or is it a trial separation?
  Is it just a big argument? Are we seeing buyers' remorse?\" She recognised the reality
  that there wasn't a desire to go back, but how Parliament reacted now would make
  a big difference to what happened next. She agreed there might be a case for a second
  referendum on the result of the final negotiations… what was actually on sale in
  the shop the voters had walked into, and at what price we would be charged for leaving
  the EU. \n\nShe thought political Brexiteers underestimated what the links were
  between the UK and the EU. \"Think of it as an organ inside a body. You can take
  the heart out and think it functions very well on its own, but then when you think
  about the chemistry that needs to be in balance to keep it going, and the arteries
  and the veins running from it…  Sometimes you don't know what the implications are
  going to be.\"\n\n**2,000 vs. 20 lawyers**\n\nAs for how far Parliament could influence
  the Brexit negotiations, a lawyer in the audience offered the sobering observation
  that while the government had some 2,000 lawyers at its service, Parliament had
  fewer than 20. So how would Parliament be able to obtain the expert legal advice
  it was going to need to play a meaningful part in the discussions?\n\nThe Commons
  clerk and constitutional adviser, Paul Evans, offered a final comment most of those
  present might well subscribe to: \n\n\"I'd like to think that after the nation voted
  52 to 48, we might hope that Parliament could come up with a solution that 80% of
  the population can accept as a stable one, in order to make that stark 50:50 divide
  not quite so stark.\""
