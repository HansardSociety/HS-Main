:title: Why won't the SNP be misbehaving in Westminster?
:slug: why-wont-the-snp-be-misbehaving-in-westminster
:introduction: Professor James Mitchell explains why the SNP’s Westminster contingent
  will avoid anything that risks undermining the party’s position in Edinburgh.
:copy: "Only those with little knowledge of the Scottish National Party (SNP) imagined
  that a large contingent of SNP MPs would lead to chaos and mayhem in the Palace
  of Westminster.  The SNP’s landslide - winning 56 of Scotland’s 59 seats with 50%
  of the vote - was built on eight years of SNP Government as well as the 2014 referendum.
  \ The SNP advance was not won on the promise of endless confrontation or on a hard
  left prospectus.\n\nThe background to the SNP landslide in May lies in the politics
  of devolution.  Prior to devolution the party was a marginal force in Westminster
  politics.  Devolution with its more proportional electoral system created new opportunities
  for the SNP.  The SNP became the main opposition party in Scotland for the first
  time.\n\nBut without a record of government, the SNP was vulnerable to attacks based
  on H.P. Lovecraft’s dictum that the oldest and strongest emotion is fear and the
  oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown.  An SNP Government was
  the great unknown.  However as the main opposition party the SNP benefitted when
  voters became disenchanted with Labour.  It was a combination of a Government losing
  an election and an Opposition winning.\n\n<div class=\"promo-box\">\n<p><strong>Launch

  SNP formed a minority government in 2007 after winning one more seat in Holyrood
  than Labour with less than 1 per cent more of the constituency vote.  Over the next
  four years, that foothold on power allowed the SNP to build its reputation for competence.
  \ By 2011, Alex Salmond was rated the best Scottish party leader by over 80 per
  cent of the electorate, including 64 per cent of Labour identifiers.  This exceeded
  almost all expectations, no doubt, aided by its opponent's past predictions of what
  would happen with the SNP in power. \n\nThe SNP leadership believed (or hoped) that
  this would translate into support for independence but after four years in office
  support for independence was static with only a quarter of voters choosing independence
  between the status quo, more powers and independence.\n\nIn 2011, the combination
  of its reputation for competence and the low salience of Scottish independence ensured
  that the SNP bucked the electoral system and gave it an overall majority.  Little
  attention had been paid to its manifesto commitment to a referendum on independence
  as few imagined that the SNP would command an overall majority.  But the overall
  majority ensured that a referendum was firmly on the agenda.\n\nSupport for independence
  grew over the forty months after the 2011 elections but not enough to win the referendum.
  \ But 30 per cent of those who had voted Labour in 2011 supported independence in
  the referendum.  This loosened attachment to the Labour Party.  A key part of this
  was the anti-Conservative message that dominated the campaign for independence.
  \ The referendum was a staging post for Labour voters to move to the SNP.  Labour’s
  association with the Conservatives in the referendum had the same effect on Labour
  support as joining the coalition with the Conservatives had had on the Liberal Democrats.\n\nThe
  impact of the referendum on the SNP’s prospects at the UK general election only
  eight months later was considerable but more complex than simply reflecting an increase
  in support for independence.  Support for independence had been mobilized and relatively
  easily channeled into support for the SNP.  A couple of years before, opponent's
  of the SNP had assumed that a decisive victory for the union would damage the SNP
  and undermine its support at the UK general election in 2015 and the Scottish elections
  in 2016.  The referendum proved a Pyrrhic victory for Labour and the SNP’s defeat
  the opposite.\n\nThe SNP appeal in 2015 was, as in its previous electoral advances,
  based on reassuring messages.  Labour and SNP had competed to be the anti-Tory party
  in Scotland and the SNP’s unambiguous anti-austerity message was clear.  The SNP
  insisted that the May 2015 general election was not a re-run of the referendum and
  that it was not seeking a mandate to hold another referendum.  It proposed to share
  government with Labour reminding Scottish voters of its record of competence in
  Holyrood and its willingness to work with others to oppose the Conservatives.  Labour’s
  refusal to work with the SNP reminded voters of Labour working with the Conservatives
  under the banner of Better Together in the referendum.  This helped the SNP portray
  itself as the main opposition to the Conservatives in Scotland.\n\nThe SNP’s new
  MPs will try to avoid anything that might undermine the SNP Government in Edinburgh.
  \ Disruptive Parliamentary behaviour would undermine its image as a party of government
  and aim to be seen as the natural party of Scottish Government.  The SNP will strenuously
  oppose the Government.  But the SNP and Scottish public know well that oppositions
  do not govern and the SNP’s inability to block Conservative Government policy will
  provide ammunition in making the case for independence.\n\n---\n\n**Image Courtesy**:
