  About the event\n\nThe proposed refurbishment of the Palace of Westminster after
  2020 presents a rare one in 150 year opportunity for reform of the principal institution
  of our democracy.\n\nWith MPs and Peers due to move out of the Palace into alternative
  locations in the Westminster area for a few years, could these temporary new Houses
  be turned into parliamentary laboratories to trial and test new digital technology
  to support the legislative and scrutiny process?\n\nRecent innovations, for example
  in relation to data science and social media analysis, potentially offer new opportunities
  for Parliament to engage with the public, collect and analyse greater amounts of
  data and reach out to stakeholders beyond the ‘usual suspects’.\n\nBut such developments
  also pose new challenges, not least in relation to privacy and security, training,
  infrastructure and accessibility.\nThis event will explore the problems in the legislative
  process – e.g. time, speed, resources, access to expert knowledge, scrutiny capacity
  – and how new technological developments might help solve them.\n\nBringing together
  experts from Parliament and the technology sectors we will explore how Westminster
  could utilise the rupture of being uprooted from the Palace to drive innovation
  in the legislative process.\n\n## Schedule\n\n* 2.00pm: Open\n* 2.30pm: Session

  Society's work on Sense4Us, a multi-national technology research project funded
  by the European Union.*"
