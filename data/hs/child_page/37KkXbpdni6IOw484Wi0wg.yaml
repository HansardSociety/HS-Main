:title: Reflections on the Strathclyde Review
:slug: reflections-on-the-strathclyde-review
:introduction: Following the Tax Credits regulations vote last October[^1], the Prime
  Minister asked Lord Strathclyde to conduct a 'rapid review' of Statutory Instruments
  to consider ‘how more certainty and clarity could be brought to their passage through
  Parliament’[^2] and the primacy of the Commons assured.
:copy: "Just over a year ago we published the first comprehensive study of the SI
  system for nearly 80 years, *‘The Devil is in the Detail: Parliament and Delegated
  Legislation’*.[^3]  In responding to Lord Strathclyde’s report we are thus able
  to draw on three years research. Since the start of this new parliamentary session
  we have also begun to track every SI that is subject to parliamentary scrutiny,
  enabling us to maintain the most comprehensive and up to date monitor of delegated
  legislation available each week. \n\nThis response to the Strathclyde Review is
  not a comprehensive analysis of every aspect of the report; rather, it focuses on
  what we consider to be the key elements of concern, which we hope will inform the
  debate about it in the House of Lords. \n\n##This is no way to undertake reform
  – an independent inquiry into the legislative process is required\n\nOur research
  illustrates that the process by which delegated powers are provided in Acts of Parliament
  and the scrutiny procedures accorded to them is neither systematic nor consistent.
  Any distinguishing line between legislative principle and detail has long since
  been obscured and the use of delegated legislation now stretches beyond the boundary
  of reasonableness and acceptability.\n\nThe Strathclyde Review implicitly recognises
  that there is a problem noting that it would be ‘appropriate for the Government
  to take steps to ensure that Bills contain an appropriate level of detail and that
  too much is not left for implementation by statutory instrument’.[^4]  However,
  this fine declaratory statement is completely meaningless without any action attached.
  How, exactly, does Lord Strathclyde propose that the government do this? \n\nThe
  complexity of the delegated legislation process, the lack of understanding amongst
  parliamentarians and the public, and the uneven application of processes and procedures
  all point to a system that is no longer fit for purpose. Indeed, the problems with
  the system are now so serious that further patchwork reforms risk augmenting rather
  than ameliorating the difficulties. \n\nAn independent expert inquiry is needed
  along the lines of that undertaken in 1975 by David Renton on the ‘Preparation of
  Legislation’.[^5]  This should review the entire legislative process looking at:
  \n\n1. how both primary and delegated legislation is prepared in Whitehall and scrutinised
  at Westminster; \n2. issues of principle and practice, and where the balance should
  lie between administrative and political convenience and good legislative practice;
  \n3. rationalisation of scrutiny procedures; \n4. whether the burden on Members
  to scrutinise delegated legislation should be reduced through the introduction of
  individuals or independent advisory bodies with genuine technical expertise in particular
  policy areas; \n5. how the scrutiny system might be redesigned and how the burden
  of work and responsibility might be aligned across both Houses. \n\n##The inadequacy
  of House of Commons procedures\n\nThe Report seeks, through changes to Lords powers,
  to enhance the role of the elected House of Commons in the SI process. However,
  this will not happen unless Commons procedures are reformed, and the engagement
  of MPs in the scrutiny of delegated legislation is enhanced. Given the inadequate
  nature of Commons scrutiny, any reform that curtails the role of the House of Lords
  in relation to delegated legislation risks turning an already deeply flawed process
  into a farce. Consideration, in isolation, of the role of just one House in the
  delegated legislation process runs the risk of doing more harm than good. Changes
  to the Lords should only be made once full consideration has been given to the role
  of the House of Commons. \n\nIn the elected House the scrutiny process has become
  unnecessarily complex such that most MPs simply don’t understand it. And the procedures
  - particularly those for praying against negative instruments and Delegated Legislation
  Committee debates for affirmative instruments – are weak. \n\nThus, in *The Devil
  is in the Detail* we recommended a number of reforms, including:\n\n* A new, clearer
  annulment motion should be adopted, decoupled from the Early Day Motion system and
  the government’s tight control over annulment debates should be lessened.\n* Delegated
  Legislation Committees should be reformed along the lines of the European scrutiny
  committee system in the House of Lords. \n\n##Amending the Statutory Instruments
  Act 1946\n\nOur research, as well as inquiries by the Secondary Legislation Scrutiny
  Committee, highlight the often poor quality of consultation processes and provision
  of explanatory materials. In *The Devil is in the Detail* we called on the government
  to review the Act with a view to replacing it with new legislation that takes account
  of modern forms of digital communication and sets out clear, minimum standards for
  publicity and consultation concerning delegated legislation in the future. Calls
  on the government to make improvements have hitherto fallen on deaf ears. Any revision
  of the Act should therefore address this broader canvass of concerns and not just
  focus on the narrower objectives enshrined in the Strathclyde Report. \n\n##House
  of Commons only procedures for financial measures\n\nThe Report recommends a further
  review – by the government in consultation with the Procedure Committees – to determine
  the principles that should underpin Commons only procedures for financial measures
  with a view to developing a protocol to apply to the drafting of all bills with
  delegated powers. \n\nIn terms of new SIs based on powers set out in existing legislation,
  it is unclear whether Lord Strathclyde expects the application of Commons only procedures
  to be applied retrospectively. However, the Commons Treasury Committee Chair, Andrew
  Tyrie MP, has already indicated that one option that might be needed would be *‘amendment
  of some or all parent Acts’*.[^6]  If so, this has significant implications that
  would need to be carefully addressed in detail. \n\nImplicit in the Report is that
  there is broad agreement about the application of financial privilege in relation
  to Lords amendments and money bills and that this should be extended to delegated
  legislation. However, research by Professor Meg Russell of the Constitution Unit
  at UCL suggests that in fact there is a lack of transparency, information about
  decisions is scatted, and definitions are often unclear.[^7]  \n\nDelegated powers
  in hundreds of Acts of Parliament have already been granted to Ministers on the
  assumption that any SIs would be subject to approval by both Houses and that Peers
  would have an opportunity to express a view, including the ‘nuclear’ option of rejecting
  an instrument. Had they known that they might not have that opportunity they might
  have taken a different view during the passage of the bill, for example by seeking
  to constrain a power in a different way. \n\nIn our view this issue would best be
  dealt with as part of an independent inquiry into the legislative process. \n\n##Option
  1: remove the Lords from the process\n\nGiven the inadequate nature of Commons scrutiny,
  curtailing the role of the House of Lords (without any balancing reforms in the
  elected House) would risk turning an already deeply flawed process into a farce.
  Neutering the House of Lords in this way would merely empower the executive not
  the House of Commons. This option would also have significant implications for Lords
  consideration of primary legislation. Peers are likely to take a more robust stance
  with regard to the delegation of powers sought by ministers in each bill, requiring
  that more detail be put on the face of bills rather than in SIs and the scope of
  delegation being much more circumscribed than has hitherto been the case. \n\n##Option
  2: codify the convention\n\nThis would retain the Lords role in respect of SIs but
  in effect settle and codify the disputed convention on the House of Lords approach
  to delegated legislation and the restrictions on its powers that should apply. However,
  the Joint Committee on Conventions in 2006 concluded that the nature of conventions
  makes them unenforceable and therefore codifying them would be ‘a contradiction
  in terms’.[^8]  Nonetheless, some academics, for example Professor Meg Russell,
  have suggested that this option might offer a means to strike a productive deal
  – restraint by Peers in how they use their powers in relation to delegated legislation,
  in exchange for restraint by the government with regard to future appointments to
  the Upper House.[^9]  \n\n##Option 3: the preferred approach\n\nThis option is predicated
  on a shift towards a scrutiny process for SIs that is analogous to the primary bill
  process but without the provision for double insistence. \n\nThe Report repeatedly
  refers to a new process designed to provide the House of Commons with an opportunity
  to *‘think again’* in the event of disagreement, with the elected House thus being
  able to assert its primacy by overriding any Lords vote to reject an SI.  \n\nThis
  implies that the House of Commons will already have considered the SI and will be
  given the opportunity to consider the matter a second time (indeed this is stated
  explicitly in Lord Strathclyde’s foreword to the Report). \n\nHowever, our SI Tracker
  shows that 11 out of 96 affirmative SIs (11.4%) laid since the start of this Parliament
  or carried over from the last, were approved by the House of Lords before an approval
  motion was moved in the House of Commons. In these instances there would be no clear
  process for ‘thinking again’. \n\nIn relation to its proposals to suspend the operation
  of a negative SI after the Upper House has annulled it, the Report also indicates
  that the Order *‘in a great many of the cases is unlikely to be in force yet’*.
  However, our SI Tracker data shows that of 588 negative SIs (excluding drafts) laid
  this Session, including carry-overs, 429 (73%) would come into force within 40 days
  of being laid and therefore before the scrutiny period has expired. \n\nA key weakness
  of the recommendation is that it does not make clear how MPs will be invited to
  ‘think’ about and respond to SIs rejected by the Lords. If the House of Commons
  procedures do not properly provide for substantive (re)consideration of the Lords
  view on the SI then rather than underpinning the primacy of the Commons, the process
  will merely serve the interests of the executive, by granting an override power
  to MPs without requiring anything of them in terms of actively engaging with and
  making an informed decision about the concerns raised by Peers. \n\nHow then are
  MPs to be engaged with Peers’ concerns and what procedures will apply to enable
  them to reach a view? \n\nThe Report is silent on a number of vital procedural matters,
  foremost among them:  \n\n* How will the view of the House of Lords be conveyed
  effectively to the House of Commons? \n* Will the resolution be preceded by a debate
  on the floor of the House of Commons?\n* Will the matter be subject to a deferred
  division in the Commons as is the case for many SIs? \n\nBut until an answer is
  provided, Peers would be well advised to be wary about embracing this approach to
  reform. \n\n##Appendix: SI’s by the numbers\n\nDespite the recent Tax Credits experience,
  successive governments have largely enjoyed a considerable degree of certainty in
  relation to the passage of SIs. \n\n* Just 0.01% of all Statutory Instruments since
  1965 have been rejected by either House. \n* Since 1950, the government has been
  defeated on a fatal motion on just five occasions, on a non-fatal motion on 27 occasions,
  and then twice on the ‘delaying’ motion in respect of the proposed Tax Credit changes
  last October. \n* Between 2004 and 2014, in only one session (2007-08) has the House
  of Lords considered motions against more than 1% of all negative instruments.\n*
  So far, in this session alone, 32 SIs have been corrected by the government after
  they were laid before Parliament and 16 have been withdrawn because of defects or
  because it became clear the government could not win the vote. \n* Since the start
  of this session, 77 out of 724 SIs (11%) are already subject to Commons only procedures.
  \n* The number of both fatal and non-fatal motions is very modest when compared
  to the level of concern about different aspects of the system that are regularly
  ignored by successive governments. \n\n**For example:**\n\n* In the eight sessions
  up to Autumn 2014 the House of Lords Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee drew
  the attention of the House to 741 SIs about which it had serious concerns, the majority
  of which (448 or 60%) were in relation to drafting. \n\n* The quality of consultation
  and Explanatory Memorandums (EMs) for SIs is highly variable. In 2013-14 alone the
  government had to replace 6% of all EMs. \n\n---\n\n## Footnotes\n\n1. [See our
