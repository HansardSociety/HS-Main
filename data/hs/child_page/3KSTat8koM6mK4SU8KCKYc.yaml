  process to reveal the stories behind some recently published Statutory Instruments.
  This week: [The European Union Referendum (Voter Registration) Regulations 2016](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2016/9780111147405/contents).'
:copy: "Today, both Houses of Parliament will consider the European Union Referendum
  (Voter Registration) Regulations 2016, an emergency Statutory Instrument (SIs) which
  will extend the voter registration deadline for the EU referendum. This is being
  introduced as a result of the technical problems suffered by the government’s data
  website on Tuesday night which resulted in some people unable to register before
  the original deadline. \n\nThese draft Regulations are subject to the affirmative
  procedure which means that both Houses of Parliament must actively approve them
  before the provisions can come into effect. On average it takes around six to seven
  sitting weeks for the passage of an affirmative instrument through all its parliamentary
  stages. However, the EU draft regulations will be subject to ‘fast-tracked’ parliamentary
  scrutiny and all its stages will be completed today.\n\nTraditionally, the justifications
  of the use of delegated legislation have centred on the need to elaborate complex
  detail, the need for flexibility and adaptability, and perhaps more importantly,
  the capacity to act in times of emergency.  While the debate on the use of SIs in
  recent times has tended to focus on the negative aspects of the delegated legislation
  system and in particular, the use of SIs by successive governments in ways that
  were not originally intended, the circumstances surrounding these EU regulations
  highlights the importance of delegated legislation and the capacity it allows for
  governments to meet unforeseen contingencies and crises.  \n\nThere are three types
  of affirmative instrument, the most common of which is the draft affirmative SI.
  A second type, the made affirmative procedure, in which the instrument comes into
  effect immediately but cannot remain in force if rejected by any House of Parliament,
  is the best procedure for ‘fast track’ delegated legislation but can only be used
  if it is the specified procedure within the parent act in which the SI is made under.
  The power to make the European Union Referendum (Voter Registration) Regulations
  2016 is taken from the EU Referendum Act 2015 which specifies that it is to be made
  as a draft affirmative instrument and can only come into effect once it has been
  approved by both houses and signed off by the relevant minister. \n\nIn the House
  of Commons, affirmative instruments are automatically referred to a Delegated Legislation
  Committee for debate. Following the debate in Committee, an approval motion is put
  formally to the House without debate on a separate day. In order to fast-track an
  SI, the government can table a motion for the instrument to be debated on the Floor
  of the House where the approval motion question is put immediately after the debate.
  As with debates held in delegated legislation committees, MPs will have 90 minutes
  to debate the instrument. \n\nUnlike primary legislation, the scrutiny stages for
  statutory instruments in both Houses run concurrently. In the House of Lords a motion
  to approve an affirmative instrument can be taken in either Grand Committee or on
  the Floor of the House. In a similar vein to the House of Commons, if an affirmative
  instrument is debated on the Floor of the House, the approval motion question is
  put immediately after the debate. \n\nThe one key procedural change for ‘fast-tracked’
  affirmative SIs is that the House of Lords will have to dispense with Standing Order
  72 which provides that an approval motion cannot be moved until the Joint Committee
  on Statutory Instruments (JCSI) has reported on the instrument. This is a scrutiny
  reserve that the House of Commons does not observe. Normally the JCSI will try to
  report on an instrument within 12 to 16 days of it being laid. \n\nFollowing today’s
  House of Lords debate on the instrument, shadow leader of the House of Lords, Baroness
  Smith of Basildon, has a debate on the ‘balance of power between the Government
  and Parliament’, a debate which will no doubt touch on the recommendations of the
  Strathclyde Review into secondary legislation and the primacy of the House of Commons.
  Interestingly, the Strathclyde Review proposes the creation of a new procedure that
  would provide the House of Commons with an opportunity to ‘think again’ in the event
  of disagreement with the Upper House, and ultimately override any Lords vote to
  reject an SI. If implemented, this new procedure could potentially complicate matters
  for ‘fast-tracking’ delegated legislation in the future, particularly if a fixed
  period of delay before the Commons can override the Lords is introduced. \n\n*To
