:introduction: 'Our Lifting the Lid series aims to open up the delegated legislation
  process and reveal the stories behind recently published Statutory Instruments.
  This week: [The European Union Referendum (Date of Referendum Etc.) Regulations
  2016](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2016/9780111143988/contents).'
:copy: "On Monday 22nd February the government formally laid before Parliament the
  delegated legislation required to start the official campaign period before the
  EU referendum.\n\nThe European Union Referendum (Date of Referendum etc.) Regulations
  2016 formally set the date of the referendum, which will be held on Thursday 23
  June, and confirms that the referendum period, in which all campaigners will be
  subject to spending limits, will begin on Friday 15 April. \n\nThe Instrument also
  prescribes the period for which one campaign organisation can be designated as lead
  campaigner for each outcome in the referendum by the Electoral Commission. Campaigns
  can apply to become lead campaigner from Friday 4 March and the Electoral Commission
  must make its decision by Thursday 14 April, the day before the referendum period
  begins. \n\nThese Regulations are subject to the affirmative procedure which means
  that both Houses of Parliament must actively approve them before the provisions
  can come into effect. \n\nJust over 20% of Statutory Instruments laid before Parliament
  each session are subject to the affirmative procedure, which is usually assigned
  to more substantial and important pieces of delegated legislation. The vast majority
  of Statutory Instruments subject to parliamentary scrutiny are subject to the negative
  procedure, a less stringent form of parliamentary control than the affirmative procedure.
  \ Flow charts outlining the process for these two procedures can be found [here](http://www.hansardsociety.org.uk/negative-vs-affirmative-procedures-flowchart/).
  \n\nIn the House of Commons, affirmative instruments are automatically referred
  to a Delegated Legislation Committee for debate unless a motion for the instrument
  to be debated on the Floor of the House is tabled. Regulations relating to terrorism
  and security are automatically considered on the Floor of the House where they can
  be debated by all MPs for up to 90 minutes, but more usually the bulk of affirmative
  instruments are debated in committee. \n\nDelegated Legislation Committees are composed
  of 18 MPs nominated by the party whips to reflect the composition of the House.
  Debates in these committees can last up to 90 minutes and are conducted on a motion
  that ‘the committee has considered the instrument’. Following the debate in Committee,
  an approval motion is put formally to the House without debate on a separate day.
  If a debate is held on the Floor of the House, the approval motion question is put
  immediately after the debate. The vast majority of approval motions in the Commons
  are resolved without division, but if dissent is indicated the vote is deferred
  and MPs cast their vote by ballot paper between 11.30am and 2pm on the following
  Wednesday.  This has happened on four occasions in the current session. \n\nIn the
  House of Lords a motion to approve an affirmative instrument can be taken in either
  Grand Committee or on the Floor of the House. In a similar vein to the House of
  Commons, if an affirmative instrument is debated in Committee, an approval motion
  is put formally to the House without debate on a separate day.\n\nUnlike primary
  legislation, the scrutiny stages for statutory instruments in both Houses run concurrently
  but the majority of affirmative instruments are approved by the House of Commons
  before the House of Lords has approved them. \n\nCabinet Office guidance advises
  government departments to allow around six sitting weeks for the passage of an affirmative
  instrument through all its parliamentary stages.  This allows for both the Joint
  Committee on Statutory Instruments and the House of Lords Secondary Legislation
  Scrutiny Committee to consider the instrument and report on it within 12 to 16 days
  of it being laid. In the House of Lords, an approval motion cannot be moved until
  the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments has reported on the instrument. This
  is a scrutiny reserve that the House of Commons does not observe. \n\nGiven that
  the instrument prescribes time periods that begin in a little over two weeks, it
  is expected that its progress through the parliamentary stages will be rapid and
  not in keeping with the usual 6-7 week process."
