:introduction: Ireland’s 32nd parliament met for the first time on 10 March 2016 following
  a general election which returned a highly-fragmented party system and failed to
  offer an obvious coalition government option.
:copy: "The polls got it wrong! The expectation that the election would return the
  same Fine Gael-Labour Party coalition, albeit on the back of a reduced number of
  parliamentary seats, did not materialise. Instead, the election produced substantial
  gains for the opposition parties. Fianna Fáil more than doubled its seat allocation
  to 44 and Sinn Féin emerged with 23 seats, up from 14 in 2011. Smaller parties and
  Independents also fared well. They secured 34 seats, 21% of the total.  \n\nThe
  major casualty was the smaller coalition party. The 2016 election proved to be the
  Labour Party’s worst ever election. They lost 30 seats and now have just seven TDs.
  Fine Gael continues to be the largest party in Dáil Éireann but it too suffered
  losses and is currently unable to command majority support for the re-election of
  party leader, Enda Kenny, as Taoiseach. \n\nThe unexpectedly high number of seat
  losses and gains has produced a high turnover of TDs. 98 of 166 sitting TDs (MPs)
  were returned. Of these who were not returned, a relatively high proportion had
  been first-time TDs in 2011. In fact, 38% of the 2011 generation lost their seats
  in 2016. This means that the 32nd Dáil welcomes 52 first-time TDs (plus eight TDs
  who did not serve in the previous Dáil, but were elected TDs prior to 2011). This
  is not as many new TDs as in 2011 when 76 first-timers were elected following the
  so-called ‘earthquake’ election. However, it is higher than the average Irish parliamentary
  turnover figure and signals continued volatility in Irish politics. \n\nThe elevated
  rate of turnover coincides with a continuing emphasis on parliamentary reform in
  Ireland. Some reform measures were introduced during the previous parliamentary
  term. They may not have been especially ambitious, but they did marginally improve
  parliament’s capacity to influence the legislative and oversight process. \n\nThe
  most recent election has further highlighted the need for Dáil reform. The new Dáil
  arithmetic has failed to offer an obvious candidate(s) to form a government. There
  is some possibility that a minority government will emerge. This has prompted some
  reconsideration of how the Dáil does its business and may have convinced political
  parties that reform is not just necessary, but vital. \n\nFianna Fáil is the largest
  opposition party, but also a possible candidate for participation in the next government.
  The party is currently leading the charge for parliamentary reform, pushing for
  any reforms to be agreed in advance of the formation of the next government. There
  is some irony in this position. Fianna Fáil has spent more time in government than
  any other Irish political party, but failed to use these periods in power to pursue
  an ambitious reform agenda. Now on the opposition benches, it seems the appeal of
  parliamentary reform is much more compelling. The reasons are clear. Should Fianna
  Fáil choose to inhabit the opposition benches, and thereafter support a minority
  Fine Gael-led government, a more empowered parliament has an obvious allure. Such
  an institution offers a counterweight to the traditional dominance of Ireland’s
  executive and potentially allows opposition parties greater input and influence
  in Dáil Éireann.\n\nThis strong post-election narrative prompted Fine Gael to publish
  proposals for reform on 11 March 2016. The party is requesting that the recently-elected
  Ceann Comhairle (Speaker of the House) prioritise 24 reform proposals when the Dáil
  sits on 6 April 2016. These reforms include relaxing the party whip; extending Leaders’
  Questions to provide additional time for Opposition leaders; the establishment of
  a Dáil Business Management Committee; and a new mechanism overseen by the Ceann
  Comhairle to continuously review necessary reforms. Putting in place such provisions
  may provide a basis for Fine Gael to command broader parliamentary support for a
  minority-led government.  \n\nIt is not political parties alone, however, which
  have an interest in parliamentary reform. For the 2016 generation of first-time
  TDs – many of whom will be confined to the backbenches – a more influential parliament
  offers greater opportunities to have an impact on Dáil business.  \n\nThe current
  political impasse in relation to forming a government presents opportunities for
  the Irish parliament to assert itself. In order to achieve ambitious parliamentary
  reform of the sort which rebalances the relationship with the executive, a range
  of forces need to coalesce. These include not just a cross-section of political
  parties, but a critical mass of TDs – and this is where first-time TDs can record
  an important early victory. For any reform process to be successful, TDs need to
  commit to its key principles and perhaps more importantly, its spirit and intent.
  It is TDs who must ensure that reforms are applied and respected, and not cynically
  manipulated to replicate the status quo. \n\nNew TDs, as opposed to their longer-serving
  colleagues, have a key role to play. Unhindered by practical experience of how it
  did work, first-time TDs are well placed to resist old habits and behaviours. The
  uncertainty created by the 2016 election outcome can be trumped by TDs and political
  parties committing to the creation of a stronger parliamentary institution. New
  TDs have a unique opportunity to drive such an initiative. If successful, they may
  be the first generation of TDs to work in a genuinely empowered Irish parliament.
