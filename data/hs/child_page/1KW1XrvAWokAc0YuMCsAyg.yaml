:introduction: Can technology help change the culture and practice of parliamentary
  politics, particularly around the legislative process?
:copy: "That was the theme of our recent Parliament Week event exploring how technology
  and innovation can increase the capacity, strengthen scrutiny and improve public
  engagement with Westminster, drawing on findings from our involvement in the EU
  Sense4us technology research project dedicated to developing new tools to help support
  the policy and legislative process. Over the course of three posts we will look
  at some of the main take-aways from the event. You can view the full agenda and
  list of speakers on [our events page here](https://www.hansardsociety.org.uk/events/future-parliament-hacking-the-legislative-process).\n\n\"Parliament
  scores highly on transparency,\" said panelist Liam Laurence Smyth, Clerk of Legislation.
  People can very easily witness the legislative process close-up. They can watch
  all three readings of a Bill from the public gallery, attend select committee hearings
  where policy is scrutinised and sit through the line-by-line deliberation of a piece
  of legislation as it passes through a public bill committee. But what Parliament
  is not so good at is promoting a shift from sitting and viewing to acting and doing.
  \n\n**So how can Parliament begin to encourage a more meaningful interaction and
  open the legislative process to a wider public?**\n\n## **Volume and language**\n\nResearch
  commissioned by the Parliamentary Digital Service (PDS), and also borne out in our
  annual [Audit of Political Engagement](https://www.hansardsociety.org.uk/projects/audit-of-political-engagement),
  has found there is an appetite among citizens to get involved in decisions that
  matter to them. The problem, however, is they don't know how or what impact their
  contribution will have.\n\n----\n\n<span style=\"font-size:12px;color:gray;\">YOU

  has made communication channels more direct - as Stella Creasy explained, in the
  four days following the Syria vote she received 12,500 tweets and as many Facebook
  comments, a level of instant contact with MPs unheard of 10 or more years ago. But
  it is also helping to drive the broader disconnect between Parliament and the public,
  not least because MPs are struggling to cope with the volume of communication that
  washes over them like a tidal wave each week. So too, MPs are burdened by both the
  volume and complexity of legislation.\n\nOur research looking at the challenges
  facing parliamentary staff for the Sense4us technology research project also highlights
  the difficulties posed when, for example, select committee consultations generate
  a large volume of material that has to be analysed within a very tight deadline.\x05\n\nBut
  whatever the form of communication, as Emma Allen, Head of Digital Development at
  PDS explained, a significant barrier to effective engagement remains the perennial
  problem of the language used within Parliament. Stella Creasy, Labour MP for Walthamstow,
  agreed, admitting that even after six years in Parliament she still stumbles across
  obscure procedural phrases, highlighting the level of expertise required to successfully
  navigate and contribute to the legislative process. While terms like 'second reading',
  'committee stage', 'third reading' and 'Statutory Instrument' are common among those
  working in and around Westminster and the devolved legislatures, this vocabulary
  is far removed from everyday language.\n\nProgress has been made in reducing 'alien'
  language over the past 10 years since Parliament implemented many of the recommendations
  of the Society’s [Commission on the Communication of Parliamentary Democracy](http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN04106)
  chaired by Lord David Puttnam. But as Laurence Smyth explained, introducing plain,
  accessible language to the legislative process is not an easy task. Precision and
  concision may be sacrificed in legislation that is easy to follow.\n\nUp to the
  point of a white paper, issues are often fudged and lines blurred in order to gather
  the greatest amount of support for a legislative proposition. But then the drafters
  \"spoil the party\"; when it comes to the statute book, precision is critical if
  ambiguity is to be avoided. \"Clarity in legislative drafting,\" the Clerk explained,
  \"forces [legislators] to make choices so they can't blur the lines in what they
  mean.\"\n\nNonetheless, technology could play a part in augmenting the technical
  aspects of the legislative process to open it up to more people, as was tried with
  the [Public Reading trial of government bills](http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN06406).
  And earlier this year, PDS began prototyping a [Jargon Buster](https://pds.blog.parliament.uk/2016/03/16/from-rapid-start-to-incubation-this-is-chemistry-lab-time/),
  which offers definitions for technical phrases on Parliament's website by hovering
  over text. Initial testing reports 58% of users saying they would find it useful
  rolled out more widely across Parliament's services. \n\n## **A democratic duty
  to keep data in shape**\n\nA vast array of structured data lies behind the power
  of tools such as these. So, as Allen put it, PDS has \"a democratic duty to get
  the data in really good shape and released to the public”.\n\nThe new [CommonsVotes](https://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2016/november/mobile-app-for-vote-results-launched/)
  app is a good example of how they are trying to do this. Recently launched by PDS
  following rigorous user research, it utilises 'well-shaped' data to provide the
  results of House of Commons' divisions within 20 minutes of MPs having voted, visualising
  the information in a clear and engaging way, in a well-crafted interface. But despite
  strides like this - PDS is still a relatively new unit within Parliament - Allen
  acknowledged there is still plenty of parliamentary data that needs to be organised
  and published, and then packaged neatly within similarly well-designed interfaces
  to meet user-needs. \n\nQuality data is therefore key to meeting the challenge of
  making parliamentary information and language more publicly accessible. To this
  end PDS has commissioned two new initiatives. The first is in collaboration with
  the Open Data Institute (ODI), who are looking at the quality of parliamentary data,
  whether it is fit for purpose, who is using it and what steps need to be taken to
  improve it. The second, a UK-wide user-research initiative, is aiming to tackle
  the interface side of things - the immediate relationship between Parliament and
  its digital services and the public.\n\n## **A new mindset: driving cultural change**\n\nDigital
  development projects like this are crucial to Parliament’s future engagement with
  the public. But, as Allen explained, if parliaments are truly to improve what one
  audience member described as ‘the customer experience’ then they will need to be
  much more adaptive - constantly responding to technological changes as well as the
  needs of users. This will require a potentially sharp cultural shift to bring about
  closer integration of resources and deeper engagement with service users both internally
  and externally. \n\nIn order to encourage members of the public to make a more active
  contribution to the legislative process and overcome the challenge presented by
  a 'look but don't touch' façade, the panel concluded that Parliament must lay the
  groundwork for people to *understand* what is happening in a way that is meaningful
  to them. Part of this in turn is understanding how people themselves want to engage
  with Parliament and, as we shall see in the next post, in conversations with each
  other.\n\n*Sense4us is a project funded from the European Union's Seventh Framework
