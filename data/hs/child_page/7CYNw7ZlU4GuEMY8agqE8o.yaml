:title: Why Parliament needs a 'good Brexit'
:slug: why-parliament-needs-a-good-brexit
:introduction: There are two scenarios for the way in which Parliament's handling
  of Brexit affects its position in the UK’s democratic system – one in which Brexit
  strengthens the executive, and one in which Parliament emerges enhanced.
:copy: "Which of these prevails could have an effect long after the UK leaves the
  EU. If Parliament has a ‘good Brexit’, it could strengthen its standing in relation
  to both the executive and the public.\n\nThe UK’s vote to leave the EU was ‘a vote
  to restore … our parliamentary democracy’, the prime minister declared in her [January
  17 Brexit speech](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/the-governments-negotiating-objectives-for-exiting-the-eu-pm-speech).
  Theresa May suggested that the UK’s possession of ‘the principle of parliamentary
  sovereignty [as] the basis of our unwritten constitutional settlement’ was among
  the reasons the country decided it cannot continue to operate inside a supranational
  framework. And yet this reaffirmation of the traditional role of the UK parliament,
  delivered as part of one of the most important prime ministerial policy announcements
  in a generation, was delivered in a building managed by the Foreign Office, not
  at Westminster. \n\nThe irony has not been lost on many politicians and commentators
  reacting to Mrs May’s speech, [including the Leader of the Opposition](https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2017-01-18/debates/F0E31FD2-3C8B-4593-B1BB-4A8BF1188DD4/Engagements).
  The disjunction seemed to encapsulate one of the central tensions in the Brexit
  process, namely its potential to either expand or undermine the role of Parliament
  in the UK’s democratic system. Especially now that the arguments about process that
  surrounded the prime minister’s speech have been followed by the news that the Supreme
  Court will rule on the scope of the government’s prerogative powers on January 24,
  they have refocused attention on the implications of Brexit for the legislature.\n\n>
  \"... the EU referendum and withdrawal process represents a significant challenge
  to the UK’s traditional system of representative democracy\"\n\nRegardless of positions
  on Brexit, and the type of Brexit the prime minister has now said she will pursue,
  the EU referendum and withdrawal process represents a significant challenge to the
  UK’s traditional system of representative democracy. The UK is now embarked on one
  of the most consequential policies of its post-1945 history without this ever having
  been the policy of a government formed as a result of a general election. Before
  the referendum, EU withdrawal was the official policy of only two of the ten parties
  represented in the House of Commons (not counting Sinn Féin), mustering nine MPs
  between them (eight DUP and one UKIP). Taking Conservative, Labour and UUP splits
  into account, only [158 of 650 MPs - 24% - are reckoned to have backed ‘Leave’](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35616946).
  The proportion of peers backing Brexit was probably even lower. \n\nAnd yet Parliament
  must now help deliver Brexit – because, as Secretary of State for Exiting the EU
  David Davis has said, [the government ‘will not allow anyone to veto the decision
  of the British people’](https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2016-10-12/debates/F327EC64-3777-4D40-A98D-BEC2E11763A2/ParliamentaryScrutinyOfLeavingTheEU?highlight=%22decision%20of%20the%20British%20people%22#contribution-0DF2FA87-DB69-4C44-8615-DBDD74823F34).
  Taken to its logical conclusion, this argument would raise fundamental questions
  about the point of having parliamentary representatives. As Winston Churchill said
  in 1955 (in remarks reproduced in the Hansard Society’s journal, *Parliamentary
  Affairs*), ‘the first duty of a member of Parliament is to do what he thinks in
  his faithful and disinterested judgement is right and necessary for the honour and
  safety of Great Britain’ [^1].  As may become clear in voting on any bill to trigger
  Article 50 in coming days, the [dilemma is most acute for ‘Remain’-supporting MPs
  representing ‘Leave’-supporting constituencies](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/19/shadow-cabinet-mps-considering-voting-against-article-50-labour-brexit-theresa-may-jeremy-corbyn).
  \n\nFurthermore, Parliament is required to help deliver Brexit not only in a technical,
  procedural tense but also in such a way that it helps meet one of the promises of
  the ‘Leave’ campaign - to ‘take back control’. Parliament's role in Brexit should
  be among the criteria used to gauge whether the UK ‘makes a success of it’ and delivers
  on the demands and hopes vested in the ‘Leave’ vote. But the demand to ‘take back
  control’ goes to the heart of the relationship between representatives and voters.
  Who is ‘taking back control’? - a Parliament of representatives exercising judgement,
  or voters who want a previously out-of-touch elite to enact their priorities and
  views? Much of the public language surrounding the phrase since the referendum has
  evidenced a tricky elision between parliamentary and popular sovereignty.        \n\n##
  **Three functions ...**\n\nParliament has three functions in the Brexit process:\n\n1.
  to play its role in the international treaty-making and - unmaking that will be
  involved;\n2. to scrutinise the executive’s handling of the process; and \n3. to
  put in place the domestic law needed or desired to effect the UK’s EU withdrawal.
  \n\nThese three functions will frame the Hansard Society’s work on Brexit this year
  and beyond. In 2017, the three will come into focus roughly sequentially. Parliament's
  treaty role will be defined by the prime minister’s commitment in her speech to
  give both houses a vote on the UK-EU exit agreement, then the Supreme Court’s Article
  50 ruling on January 24, and then the passage of any Article 50 bill by the end
  of March. As regards scrutiny, much work is already underway, particularly in select
  committees, but - especially now that the government appears to have resiled from
  a commitment to publish a pre-Article 50 document - the scope of Parliament's Brexit
  scrutiny is likely to be at the forefront of the arguments surrounding any Article
  50 bill after the Supreme Court rules. Once Article 50 is triggered in late March,
  parliamentary scrutiny will then be put to the test as the Brexit negotiations get
  underway. The domestic legislation involved in Brexit will come into focus with
  the Great Repeal Bill, which will be included in the Queen’s Speech at the start
  of the new parliamentary session in May.\n\n## **... and two scenarios**\n\nCombined,
  the way in which Parliament carries out these three functions could take it towards
  one or other of two scenarios:\n\n### **1. ‘Empowered executive’**\n\nBrexit results
  in an empowered executive. The government’s customary advantage over Parliament
  in international affairs is bolstered by the political imperative to be seen to
  be delivering the referendum result, and the practical urgency of getting a vast
  amount done quickly. In the face of Brexit’s scale and complexity, Parliament fails
  to rise to the challenge and has little impact on the process, thanks to a lack
  of time and resources, often limited understanding of EU issues, enduring post-referendum
  political divisions, poor coordination among the many parliamentary actors involved,
  distraction by other issues and the political effects of extra-parliamentary campaigning
  against any perceived obstruction to implementation of the referendum result.          \n\n###
  **2. ‘Enhanced parliament’**\n\nBrexit enhances Parliament's influence and standing.
  The unexpected and unprecedented nature of Brexit proves to be a leveller between
  the executive and legislature. Brexit’s pan-UK but territorially differentiated
  nature spurs the building of stronger relationships between Westminster and the
  devolved legislatures. Parliament takes advantage of the post-referendum space for
  policy development and unconventional coalition-building, the government’s internal
  differences and small Commons majority, high public interest, and the precedent
  of a parliamentary EU scrutiny system that has sometimes been capable of holding
  the government up, to become a key site for information-gathering and dissemination,
  policy generation, consensus-building and decision-making. \n\nThe Hansard Society
  is interested in which of these scenarios plays out, and why. \n\n## **Why does
  it matter?**\n\nWe think it matters, for three reasons. \n\n**First**, Parliament
  could make a difference to Brexit’s policy content – the future trade terms between
  the UK and the EU, or the post-Brexit policies that the UK adopts in agriculture,
  regional development, higher education or immigration. This will depend on parliamentarians
  exploiting the opportunities open to them.  \n\n**Second**, the handling of Brexit,
  across Parliament's three functions, will create processes and precedents that could
  endure into - or at least shape - the post-Brexit era. For example, international
  treaty-making will be a more prominent and possibly more extensive element of UK
  foreign policy once the UK is able to negotiate international trade agreements on
  its own. The Supreme Court ruling and the treatment of any UK-EU Brexit-related
  agreement or agreements will set frameworks and precedents for Parliament's role
  in this respect. The House of Lords EU Committee has already suggested, in its [October
  2016 report on Brexit scrutiny](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201617/ldselect/ldeucom/50/50.pdf),
  that any system established to give Parliament some control of the Brexit negotiations
  could become the template for the handling of any post-Brexit international trade
  deals. \n\nSimilarly, the [Hansard Society has already argued](http://blog.hansardsociety.org.uk/will-the-great-repeal-bill-be-another-abolition-of-parliament-bill/)
  that the likely volume and importance of Brexit-related delegated legislation ought
  finally to be the spur to long-overdue reform of Parliament's scrutiny procedures
  for this class of law, primarily in the House of Commons. The prospect of the Great
  Repeal Bill has prompted the House of Lords Constitution Committee to bring forward
  the delegated powers element of [its inquiry into the legislative process](http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/lords-select/constitution-committee/news-parliament-2015/launch-delegated-powers/),
  and the House of Commons Procedure Committee might also look into delegated legislation.
  Relations between the two Houses, and between Westminster and the devolved legislatures,
  are other areas where the Brexit process could have a lasting impact; while, from
  among select committee chairs, who is seen to have had a ‘good Brexit’ could help
  shape the select committee system for the post-Brexit age.   \n\n**Third**, as indicated
  above, Parliament's constitutional and political role is at stake. Parliament -
  not just individual parliamentarians - needs to have a ‘good Brexit’. Get it wrong
  (our first scenario above), and Parliament's weaknesses could be among the relatively
  few things left unchanged by Brexit. Get it right - ‘make a success of it’ - and
  a reformed legislature could enter the post-Brexit era better connected with citizens
  and a more equal player in the UK’s democratic politics. An early indicator of the
  possible direction of travel will come with the Hansard Society’s latest annual
  [Audit of Political Engagement](http://www.auditofpoliticalengagement.org), the
  first results of which are just in… \n\n---\n\n[^1]: Winston Churchill, ‘The duties
