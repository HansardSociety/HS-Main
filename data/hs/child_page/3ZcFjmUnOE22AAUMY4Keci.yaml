:title: Tuned in or Turned Off? Public Attitudes to Prime Minister's Questions
:slug: tuned-in-or-turned-off-public-attitudes-to-prime-ministers-questions
:introduction: Famous around the world for its combative and adversarial atmosphere,
  PMQs is Parliament’s shop window. But some fear that the weekly joust is now so
  rowdy that it is bringing the House of Commons into disrepute. But what do the public
  think about it?
:copy: "## Why we are doing it \n\nPMQ's is like parliamentary 'Marmite': politicians
  and journalists either love it or loathe it. Its detractors argue that the noise
  and partisan point-scoring is now so off-putting that it feeds the public's anti-politics,
  anti-politician mood. Its defenders argue that if it is toned down no on will watch
  it and the public will be even more detached from parliamentary activity than ever.
  They contend that it is a uniquely valuable opportunity to hold the leader of the
  country to account each week; its detractors consider it to be risible scrutiny.
  But what do the public think about it? \n\n## What we are doing\n\nSurprisingly,
  given that criticism of PMQs has intensified in recent years, there is remarkably
  little quantitative or qualitative research on the subject. The assumptions and
  opinions of the 'Westminster village' have largely substituted for substantive evidence.\n\nBut
  since 2013, through online focus group discussions conducted in partnership with
  YouGov, and our annual [Audit of Political Engagement](/research/audit-of-political-engagement)
  opinion polls conducted by Ipsos MORI, we have tracked the public mood to PMQs and
  suggested a range of reforms to improve the culture and conduct of the event.  \n\n##
  Our findings\n\nBecause the public see Parliament largely through the prism of the
  House of Commons chamber, they commonly assume that PMQs is therefore how Parliament
  works all the time. It acts as a 'cue' for their wider perceptions of the institution,
  providing a lot of the raw material that feeds their negative assumptions about
  politicians and politics.\n\nIn principle, the public recognise that PMQs is an
  important part of the democratic process because of the opportunity to hold the
  government to account. But PMQs in practice alienates, angers and frustrates. Overwhelmingly
  people dislike the noise, the point-scoring and the perceived failure to answer
  the questions. The atmosphere, particularly the noise, confuses viewers and makes
  them feel uncomfortable. \n\nThe conduct of MPs is perceived to be childish, like
  school-children in a playground. This behaviour is contrasted negatively with people's
  own experience in the workplace. One participant during our focus groups summed
  up the frustration that MPs don't set a better example: '..They do argue like children.
  I mean can you imagine any other sphere of adult life where one would act with so
  little respect'. \n\nThe theatrical and pantomime aspects are also disliked. Said
  another participant having watched a clip of PMQs, 'A rousing speech, and passionate
  conviction is a good thing. This was noise and bluster and showing off – theatrical,
  but not good.' \n\nThe theatrical elements - the 'farce drama' - also give rise
  to suspicion about the motives of the politicians involved. The public doubt the
  authenticity of what they see and consequently consider it dishonest.  \n\nBut perhaps
  what should worry MPs most of all is that the public think they are ridiculing situations
  and issues that affect the lives of ordinary people instead of taking them seriously.
  \n\nOur [Audit of Political Engagement](/research/audit-of-political-engagement)
  opinion poll results broadly confirm the focus group findings. Public perceptions
  remain overwhelmingly negative and when PMQs does appeal to citizens it does so
  at a rational rather than an emotional level.\n\nThe latest results are outlined
  in Audit 13:\n\n* 69% say there is 'too much party political point scoring instead
  of answering the question' \n* 50% consider it 'too noisy and aggressive' \n* 45%
  think it 'deals with important issues facing the country' \n* 38% agree that it
  is 'informative'\n* 32% say it puts them off politics \n  * 22% think it is 'exciting
  to watch' \n  * 18% believe 'MPs behave professionally' \n  * 17% say it makes them
  'proud of Parliament' \n* Those who have seen PMQs in full are less likely to say
  it puts them off politics (28%) than those who have seen it only in edited clip
  form (35%). \n\n## Our funding \n\nBetween 2013-16, funding to support this research
  was provided by the House of Commons and the Cabinet Office via the Audit of Political
  Engagement project, supplemented by funding from the Hansard Society's own core
  resources.  \n"
