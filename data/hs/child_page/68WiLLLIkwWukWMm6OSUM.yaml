:title: Will the Great Repeal Bill be another ‘Abolish Parliament’ bill?
:slug: will-the-great-repeal-bill-be-another-abolish-parliament-bill
:introduction: The government heralds its proposed ‘Great Repeal Bill’ as the Bill
  to ‘give Parliament its sovereignty back’ upon Brexit.
:copy: "In reality, it will most probably ask Parliament to hand over a very large
  blank cheque for ministers to legislate by diktat, driving a coach and horses through
  the principle of parliamentary government. If Parliamentarians wish to avoid another
  ‘Abolition of Parliament Bill’ they must finally engage with and remedy the many
  deficiencies within the delegated legislation process.\n\nFour months on from the
  country’s historic vote to leave the European Union, a picture is starting to emerge
  about how the government intends to realise Brexit. But this picture sees a minimal
  role for Parliament in the Brexit process. This is encapsulated by the proposed
  ‘Great Repeal Bill’, to be included in the 2017 Queen’s Speech, repealing the European
  Communities Acts 1972 on Brexit day, ending the primacy of EU law in the UK.  \n\nRather
  than repealing any law, the Bill will convert existing EU law into domestic law
  on Brexit day. Sensibly, this approach provides more time for Parliament to undertake
  the enormously challenging task of reviewing the large corpus of EU law to determine
  what should be kept, amended, or removed, a process described by former parliamentary
  counsel Daniel Greenberg as “the largest scale legislation and policy exercise that
  has ever been carried out”.[^1]\n\n##**Brexit and delegated legislation**##\n\nBut
  how much of this process will actually involve Parliament? In an earlier [blog post](http://blog.hansardsociety.org.uk/its-brexit-so-what-now-for-parliament/)
  we stated that, given the volume of legislation involved, in practice much of this
  heavy lifting will probably have to be done via delegation through statutory instruments
  (SIs). The government confirmed as much in stating that the Bill will include powers
  for ministers to make ‘some’ changes via delegated legislation. \n\nTraditionally,
  the justifications for using delegated legislation have been the need to elaborate
  complex and technical detail that cannot be easily done on the face of a Bill; the
  need for flexibility and adaptability; the advantage of involving external expertise;
  and the capacity to act quickly in times of crisis and emergency. Based on these
  criteria, the reliance on delegated legislation to implement the review of EU law
  would be justified. Crucially however, the acceptance of the system of delegated
  legislation has been predicated on its reasonable use and application by ministers
  coupled with trust in Parliament’s system of scrutiny. On both these counts the
  proposed Great Repeal Bill is problematic. \n\nAs noted in our 2014 publication,
  The Devil is in the Detail: Parliament and Delegated Legislation, there is no longer
  trust in Parliament’s ability to constrain the executive’s dominance of the delegated
  legislation system because the procedures for parliamentary scrutiny of statutory
  instruments, particularly in the House of Commons, are utterly inadequate. Along
  with weak procedures, the scrutiny process has become so unnecessarily complex that
  most MPs simply don’t understand it and coupled with the fact that Parliament does
  not currently hold the power of amendment, MPs’ engagement in the scrutiny process
  is poor. \n\n##**Henry VIII powers**##\n\nThese scrutiny inadequacies are all the
  more significant given that it is extremely likely that the Great Repeal Bill will
  include powers for ministers to amend and repeal primary legislation by SI – also
  known as Henry VIII powers. \n\nDelegated legislation was once used only for matters
  that were technical or inconsequential and very procedural in character. However,
  successive governments have increasingly gone beyond the boundary of reasonableness
  and acceptability in their use of delegated legislation. Any distinguishing line
  between legislative principle and detail has long since been obscured. There has
  been such an expansion in the scope and application of powers that a precedent could
  arguably be found to justify almost any form of delegation a minister might now
  desire.\n\nIn recent years increasing concern has been expressed over the continued
  delegation of Henry VIII powers by Parliament to ministers to amend or repeal primary
  legislation by SI, with little or no scrutiny, not least because it undermines the
  constitutional principle that Parliament is the sole legislative authority with
  the power to create, amend or repeal any law. Former Chief Justice Lord Judge has
  been a leading voice in denouncing the ‘pernicious habit’ of successive governments
  in claiming such powers and in a series of hard-hitting speeches has called on Henry
  VIII clauses to be condemned to the ‘dustbin of history’. \n\n##**A second ‘Abolition
  of Parliament Bill’?**##\n\nWhile we still await the final detail of the Great Repeal
  Bill, the nature of the legislative task it is designed to undertake, and the rhetoric
  used by the government thus far all point in the direction of  it including a number
  of very broad Henry VIII powers. Notably, the wording used in the government’s press
  release that the Bill will allow Parliament to ‘amend, repeal or improve any law’
  invokes memories of the widely criticised 2006 Legislative and Regulatory Reform
  Bill, dubbed on its introduction as the ‘abolition of Parliament Bill’ and ‘the
  bill to end all bills’. Much will depend on how the Bill is drafted but already
  vague words being bandied around like ‘improve’ any law should alert parliamentarians
  to the dangers of granting ministers poorly defined powers that enable them to decide
  whatever they wish it to mean. Rather than restore parliamentary sovereignty, the
  Great Repeal Bill could amount to nothing more than government by ministerial diktat,
  providing a blank cheque for ministers to legislate with limited oversight by Parliament.\n\nThis
  is not scaremongering for successive governments have form in this area. Skeleton
  Bills such as the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill, where the majority of
  the legislative content is left to delegated legislation, are now a regular feature
  of the legislative process and in recent years ministers have sought generalised
  powers by delegated legislation to repeal legislation deemed to be ‘no longer of
  practical use’, and to make provisions with retrospective effect if they ‘consider
  it necessary or desirable’. Such wording hands ministers scope for elastic interpretation.
  \ \n\n##**Appropriate scrutiny and debate?**##\n\nThe government has indicated that
  any changes to law under the Great Repeal Bill will be afforded ‘appropriate scrutiny
  and debate’. Parliament will have a role in deciding which scrutiny procedure is
  most ‘appropriate’. Strengthened scrutiny procedures, usually reserved for delegated
  powers that amend primary legislation, are currently the most stringent form of
  parliamentary control available to MPs and peers. \n\nThere are 11 types of strengthened
  scrutiny procedure, each one a little different from the other, adding another layer
  of complexity to an already overly-complex process. They rarely reflect the substance
  of the power delegated within the Bill. These strengthened procedures share a number
  of common features including a requirement to consult and committee involvement
  in both Houses. The process by which scrutiny procedures are assigned to delegated
  powers is far from perfect. They are often bartering chips used by the government
  to buy off opposition, particularly to avoid conceding a power of veto to a scrutiny
  committee during a bill’s passage. At present only two statutes provide a veto power:
  the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006 and the Localism Act 2011. \n\nGiven
  the historic nature of the legislative exercise that the Great Repeal Bill will
  embody, it is not unreasonable to think that it may require the creation of a new
  12th scrutiny procedure and that Parliament might wish to insist on a veto power
  in order to constrain the executive. If strengthened scrutiny was needed for the
  Public Bodies Bill and the Localism Bill in the last Parliament then why not for
  the Great Repeal Bill in this one? \n\nHowever, again the Legislative and Regulatory
  Reform Act stands as a salutary lesson. Given the broad, unconfined nature of the
  powers sought by ministers in the original bill, Parliament insisted on constraining
  them through new Legislative Reform Orders. But it can take between 11 and 18 months
  to complete a Legislative Reform Order, negating the advantages of legislating with
  speed and flexibility rather than putting the matters on the face of the Bill. As
  a result, only 31 Legislative Reform Orders have been laid since the legislation
  received achieved Royal Assent in 2006.  Given the scale of the legislative exercise
  now facing Parliament as a result of Brexit, it is hard to imagine that this route
  will therefore offer a viable solution to the problem. But at present, the only
  alternatives are the less stringent processes afforded to powers subject to the
  negative or affirmative scrutiny procedures both of which generally favour the executive.
  In short, neither scrutiny approach is satisfactory at the best of times, but it
  will certainly not meet the needs of the Brexit legislative overhaul. \n\n##**What
  next?**##\n\nIn recent weeks, a few backbenchers have called for the Great Repeal
  Bill to be published in draft subjecting it to pre-legislative scrutiny. This certainly
  benefitted the draft Deregulation Bill 2013 when, in response to the Bill’s Joint
  Committee recommendations, the government removed entirely from the Bill the power
  to repeal legislation ‘of no practical use’.  \n\nBut there is an opportunity here
  to address the wider problems inherent in the delegated legislation process, particularly
  in regard to scrutiny procedures. Arguably, there may never be a better time to
  do so. \n\nUp until now, the complexity of the delegated legislation process, the
  lack of understanding amongst parliamentarians and the sheer scale of its problems
  has led to inertia. Parliamentarians, particularly MPs, have been both unwilling
  and unable to engage with the delegated legislation process and confront its many
  problems head on. But Brexit is now the defining issue facing the UK and delegated
  legislation will play a big role in the Brexit Process. \n\nAdvocates of leave campaigned
  ostensibly to restore the influence of Parliament, but if they fail to take note
  of the inadequacies of the delegated legislation process, the government not the
  legislature will be empowered by Brexit. Bluntly, if Brexit and the Great Repeal
  Bill can’t finally engage MPs with the delegated legislation process, what will?\n\nWhere
  could parliamentarians start? The recently announced year-long House of Lords Constitution
  Committee inquiry into the legislative process is a welcome step, but its remit
  is perhaps too broad to address the problems with the delegated legislation process
  in great detail. Also, many of the inadequacies are Commons related, and the Lords
  may be, quite understandably, unwilling to comment on the Lower House’s procedures.
  The Commons Procedure Committee initiated an inquiry into delegated legislation
  in the last Parliament but made little headway before the last election. \n\nGiven
  the scale and complexity of the legislative demands that Brexit will impose, a fresh
  look at the system is needed. If we had a blank sheet of paper, no sane person would
  design the scrutiny system we now have. Brexit should be the trigger for a complete
  overhaul. \n\nA Joint Committee of both Houses would be one option, enabling any
  review to consider the complementary roles and experience of both Houses. Thinking
  radically, a joint Commission under the auspices of the Speakers in both Houses
  might make some headway. An independent inquiry, involving outside experts who can
  bring fresh ideas and perspectives would be another route. \n\nIf nothing is done
  then parliamentarians will be acquiescent in empowering the government at the expense
  of the legislature and according ministers ‘despotic’ powers to determine the future
  content of the statute book untroubled by the inconvenience of detailed scrutiny.
