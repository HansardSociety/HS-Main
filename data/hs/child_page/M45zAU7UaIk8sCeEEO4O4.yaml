:title: Delegated Legislation
:slug: delegated-legislation
:introduction: Most of the UK’s general public law is made not through Acts of Parliament
  but through delegated legislation. It is crucial to the effective operation of government
  and affects millions of people each day. But despite its volume and importance,
  remarkably little attention is paid to it.
:copy: "## What we are doing\n\nIn late 2014 we published the first comprehensive
  study of the delegated legislation system in over 90 years. Our report, *The Devil
  is in the Detail: Parliament and Delegated Legislation*, opens up the process, exploring
  how decisions are made about what goes in to primary and what goes in to delegated
  legislation and who makes them. It looks at how the process works in both Houses
  of Parliament and, using legislative case studies, illustrates different aspects
  of the flaws and defects in the current system.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\"

  to the process of law-making is not in doubt, the process by which delegated legislation
  is drafted in Whitehall and scrutinised in Westminster is deeply flawed. \n\nThe
  acceptance of the system of delegated legislation has been predicated on its reasonable
  use and application by ministers coupled with trust in Parliament’s system of scrutiny.
  But in recent years, the use of delegated legislation by successive governments
  has increasingly drifted into areas of principle and policy rather than the regulation
  of administrative procedures and technical areas of operational detail. There has
  been such an expansion in the scope and application of powers and procedures that
  a precedent could arguably be found to justify almost any form of delegation a minister
  might now desire.\n\nThe scrutiny process for delegated legislation has become unnecessarily
  complex such that most MPs simply don’t understand it. And the procedures - particularly
  those for praying against negative instruments and Delegated Legislation Committee
  debates for affirmative instruments – are illogical and weak. The process confuses
  and intimidates in equal measure, serving to wrap it in a fog of obscurity.\n\nBusiness
  and civil society groups with a real interest in a particular subject are often
  baffled by the process. The role and interests of the public are almost completely
  ignored.\nThe complexity of the process, the lack of understanding among parliamentarians
  and the public, the uneven application of processes and procedures, and the extent
  to which these now undermine the principle and time-saving purpose of delegation
  all point to a system that is not fit for purpose.\n\nOur report concludes that
  the defects in the system are now so serious that piecemeal reform of existing processes
  and procedures is likely to exacerbate rather than ameliorate the problems. It calls
  instead for a comprehensive inquiry into the legislative process to be established
  after the general election to look at the issues afresh and in light of developments
  in relation to the devolution settlement and EU legislation.\n\n## Our impact \n\nWidely
  regarded as the authoritative text on delegated legislation, *The Devil is in the
  Detail* is used as a procedural reference guide by parliamentary clerks and officials.\n\nIn
  2014, the report’s co-authors appeared before the House of Commons Procedure Committee
  to give evidence on the subject and in 2016 they appeared before the House of Lords
  Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee to give evidence on Lord Strathclyde’s
  review into the powers of the Upper House in relation to delegated legislation.
  Subsequent reports  by the House of Lords Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform
  Committee and the House of Lords Constitution Committee quoted extensively from
  their evidence and *The Devil is in the Detail* research. "
