  ## Our mission

  The Hansard Society believes that the health of representative democracy rests on the foundation of a strong Parliament and an informed and engaged citizenry.

  An independent, non-partisan political research and education Society, our work is devoted to:

  1. __Exploring the evolution of representative democracy__: offering evidence-based ideas for reform of political and parliamentary institutions, processes and culture to help foster democratic renewal.
  2. __Educating citizens, particularly young people__: so that they have the knowledge and confidence to play an active role in our democracy and be future leaders in civic and political life.
  3. __Connecting citizens with parliamentarians and policy-makers__: through innovative on and off-line initiatives to address the democratic deficit.
  4. __Convening debate on topical political issues__: providing a non-partisan forum for the exchange of ideas about our democratic future.

  Our annual reports and information about our funding can be found on the ‘How we are funded’ section.
