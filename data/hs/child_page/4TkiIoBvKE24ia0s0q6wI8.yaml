  Instrument?
:slug: licence-to-kill-should-the-house-of-lords-veto-the-tax-credits-statutory
:introduction: Just 20 lines of legislation may threaten a constitutional stand-off
  if the House of Lords vetoes the [Tax Credits (Income Thresholds and Determination
  of Rates) (Amendment) Regulations 2015](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2015/9780111138946)
  this week.
:copy: "According to Ministers and various Conservative backbenchers who have taken
  to the airwaves in recent days, the unelected House of Lords has no right to hold
  up a finance/tax measure and that to veto such a Statutory Instrument would be unprecedented.
  Ministers claim they have a mandate to make the changes to Tax Credits and if the
  House of Lords vetoes the Regulation it will blow a huge hole in the government’s
  financial plan and reform of the welfare system. The political facts are sorted
  from the constitutional myths in an [excellent blog by Lords expert, Meg Russell,
  at the Constitution Unit](http://constitution-unit.com/2015/10/22/the-lords-and-tax-credits-fact-and-myth/).
  \ But an interesting by-product of this debate is the sudden focus on delegated
  legislation both in Parliament and the media. \n\nIn our book on the subject, published
  last year – [The Devil is in the Detail: Parliament and Delegated Legislation](http://www.hansardsociety.org.uk/research/delegatedlegislation/)
  – we urged the House of Lords to consider making greater, albeit judicious, use
  of its veto power in the future in order to tame government abuse of the system
  of delegated legislation. And we argued that given the inadequate nature of Commons
  scrutiny of SIs, the Lords should be empowered to scrutinise delegated legislation
  in the financial sphere. \n\nToday, much of what we are seeing in the Tax Credit
  debate reflects some of our key concerns about the process as set out in that research.
  \n\n##Inconsequential? \n\nDelegated legislation was once used only for matters
  that were technical or inconsequential. Given the financial implications of the
  proposed changes - running to billions of pounds – they certainly cannot be regarded
  as inconsequential. Whilst there has been a significant growth in the number of
  SIs in recent years, such that the scale of what is proposed is not unusual, it
  does highlight how successive governments have increasingly gone beyond the boundary
  of reasonableness and acceptability in their use of delegated legislation. Any line
  distinguishing between legislative principle and detail has long since been obscured
  and convenience all too often overrides good practice. \n\nThe government had the
  option of including the measures in the Finance Bill which would have allowed for
  broader scrutiny in the Commons, consideration by the Treasury Select Committee,
  and excluded the Lords from the process. But it chose the SI route instead, using
  the powers delegated to Ministers in the [Tax Credits Act 2002](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/21/contents)
  which explicitly states that the matter should be approved by both Houses. Indeed
  when the original Tax Credit regulations were introduced in 2002, and in the 13
  instances when they have since been uprated using the same powers, the SIs were
  approved by both Houses without hitch or controversy. The right of Peers to scrutinize
  and take a view on them was not contested.  \n\n##Financial scrutiny\n\nGovernment
  can and does introduce SIs on financial issues that are to be considered only by
  the House of Commons. The recent [Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (Initial
  Capital Contribution) Order 2015](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2015/9780111138960/pdfs/ukdsiem_9780111138960_en.pdf),
  authorizing over £3 billion of expenditure is a Commons only SI. But this is not
  the case with the Tax Credits regulation. \n\nMinisters are therefore wrong to question
  the constitutional right of Peers to take a view on the SI. Peers will be acting
  within their procedural rights and responsibilities to consider it. What is in question
  is whether rejecting the SI would be a judicious use of that power in the circumstances.
  \n\nIn choosing the SI route rather than primary legislation Ministers would have
  expected little opposition for it is rare for MPs or Peers to oppose them. SI’s,
  with just a few exceptions, cannot be amended by MPs or Peers in keeping with the
  principle of delegation of powers to Ministers. And both Houses of Parliament, as
  a rule, do not reject SIs. At of the end of 2014, just 16 SIs out of a total of
  over 169,000 – or 0.01% - had been rejected in the previous 65 years (see p186 of
  our book [The Devil is in the Detail](http://www.hansardsociety.org.uk/research/delegatedlegislation/)).
  \ \n\n##The Lords burden\n\nA heavy burden of scrutiny responsibility falls on the
  House of Lords where delegated legislation is concerned, in part because House of
  Commons procedures and the engagement of MPs is wholly inadequate. The House of
  Lords committees are more engaged in the process, more influential, and Peers generally
  have more appetite for the detail and technical scrutiny than most MPs. Some have
  suggested that there is a convention that Peers will not reject an SI but this is
  not the case and indeed it was a Conservative Leader of the House, Lord Strathclyde
  who explicitly made this clear in 1999 when, following the decision to abolish the
  hereditary peers he declared the convention dead. \n\nBut the procedures by which
  Peers consider SIs – to accept or reject with no power of amendment – means Members
  are faced with an unpalatable ‘take it or leave it’ proposition: accept an Instrument
  even if they believe it is fundamentally flawed, or reject it entirely even if some
  elements are acceptable. \n\n##An obligation to provide high quality Explanatory
  Memoranda  \n\nGiven executive dominance of the system and the limited scrutiny
  that is applied to the majority of SIs it should be a minimal requirement that Ministers
  provide Parliament and its committees with the information Members require in order
  to properly scrutinize what is proposed. And yet, time and again the House of Lords
  Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee has complained to Ministers about the poor
  quality of Explanatory Memoranda (EM) to little avail. \n\nThe Explanatory Note
  accompanying the proposed Tax Credit change has been widely criticized by all outside
  government who have considered it. The government’s own advisory body, the [Social
  Security Advisory Committee ](http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-tax-credits-income-thresholds-and-determination-of-rates-amendment-regulations-2015-ssac-comments)
  said  that it ‘was struck in particular by the lack of available evidence to support
  the policy changes being presented to us’ and ‘..would be concerned if the changes
  being proposed had not been informed by evidence, at least in some rudimentary form’.
  Having been ‘hampered in its role’ of scrutinizing the proposed changes ‘where the
  supporting explanatory material and evidence in scant’, it noted that it ‘would
  expect Parliament to want more detailed information’ that ‘clearly explains the
  changes and potential impacts to ensure that they can be subject to effective scrutiny.’
  It explicitly urged the Minister to ‘take steps to make that material available
  for that purpose’, but the government did not take up the suggestion.\n\nThe House
  of Lords [Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee was also critical](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201516/ldselect/ldsecleg/38/38.pdf)
  stating that the EM laid by HMRC in September alongside the SI ‘contained minimal
  information, given our general expectation that an EM should provide members of
  Parliament and the public with an adequate explanation of the effect of the instrument
  which it accompanies, and why it is necessary.’  The Committee requested additional
  information and received a response from the Chancellor on 12 October – information
  that was not, of course, available to MPs when they debated the Instrument in September.
  \n\nNonetheless, the Committee was still not content with the ministers response
  noting that ‘the assessment could have done more to set out the short-term impact
  on household incomes’ and that ‘the presentation of some of the material, notably
  on distribution, was difficult to understand, even for those used to economic analyses’.
  \ Having drawn the SI to the attention of the House, it noted that Peers would wish
  to consider whether the explanatory information provided was sufficient in the circumstances.
  \n\nSo Peers would not be acting without cause if they were to reject the SI this
  week. The government’s own advisory committee has expressed concern and been ignored;
  the House of Lords committee has expressed concern and is not satisfied with the
  response.  All simply want more information beyond  the ‘scant’ explanations provided
  thus far to enable Peers to reach an informed judgement on the changes. Thus three
  of the motions laid against the Regulations all involve a call for further information
  or some form of consultation. \n\n##A fatal delay?\n\nThe government has suggested
  that a delay, for whatever reason, is irrelevant and these motions, if accepted,
  would amount to a fatal veto of the SI and thereby bring about a constitutional
  crisis. Erskine May and the Lords Companion make clear that Peers can amend an approval
  motion or table a separate motion calling on the government to take a specific action
  in relation to the instrument, but this does not prevent approval of it. In July
  this year, the House of Lords voted to ‘delay the enactment of the Universal Credit
  (Waiting Days) (Amendment) Regulations 2015 until Universal Credit is fully rolled
  out’. Here, again, Peers concerns reflected those in the report by the government’s
  own advisory body, the Social Security Advisory Committee. This form of delay motion
  didn’t prompt a constitutional crisis. \n\nTwo of the proposed amendments to the
  Tax Credits approval motion also suggest a delaying tactic by inviting the House
  to decline to consider the regulations until a report, or a consultation and report,
  are produced by ministers. Another amendment proposes further consultation by government
  about the impact of the regulations but in line with the procedural position set
  out by Erskine May would not prevent approval of the regulations. \n\nThe reality
  is if the government loses the vote on the Tax Credits issue its policy need not
  come to a juddering halt. Ministers can – and frequently do – amend and relay SIs.
  We currently produce a weekly monitor of all SIs to help people outside Parliament
  understand what is going on in this vital area of legislation. Our data shows that
  so far in this session (2015-16) alone, since Parliament returned after the election,
  21 Instruments have been corrected by the government after they were laid before
  Parliament, and 13 have been withdrawn primarily because of defects or because it
  became clear the government couldn’t win the vote. \n\n##Changing course?\n\nThe
  Tax Credits SI doesn’t come into effect until 15 April 2016. The  government therefore
  has time to change course. It can either delay consideration of the SI in the Lords
  and provide more information to assuage Peers’ legitimate scrutiny concerns. Or
  it can press ahead, risk losing, and then amend and re-lay the same SI – only a
  cosmetic change (e.g. revise one word!) would be required and convention would dictate
  that the House of Lords would certainly pass it a second time. The risk here, of
  course, is that it would also have to submit the revised SI for approval to the
  Commons.  But as was demonstrated in the Opposition Day Debate last week, MPs are
  now more attuned to the proposals and the lack of detail about their impact than
  they were when they actually voted on the Regulations during the main debate in
  September. \n\nThere are, in effect, two competing accountability principles at
  stake in this debate. On the one hand, the right of the government to have its way
  on a key plank of its financial reform programme and for the primacy of the Commons
  vote in favour of the proposals to be respected by the Upper House. On the other,
  the right of parliamentarians (and the wider public) to constrain ministerial diktat
  in areas where extensive power has been delegated by requiring the government to
  adequately explain and evidence their actions. \n\nWho will blink first? Neither
  side will emerge well from the mess that will ensue if Peers do vote against the
  proposals. There are real grounds for concern about the cavalier way in which government
  treats Parliament in relation to delegated legislation. The question facing Peers
  is whether this is the issue on which they should draw the line in the sand. Would
  it constitute a ‘judicious’ use of their power to vote against these particular
  proposals? \n\nPeers can consider voting against the government on an SI only very
  rarely – they have to balance whether, given the risks, this is the one, or whether
  they would be better to keep their powder dry for another day and another issue.
  \ \n\nThey may not have to wait long. On Tuesday they are due to consider the \n[Electoral
  Registration and Administration Act 2013 (Transitional Provisions) Order 2015](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2015/1520/pdfs/uksi_20151520_en.pdf)
  \ which will bring forward the roll out of individual electoral registration a year
  earlier than is currently set out in law, potentially risking the loss of 1.9 million
  people from the electoral register. The [Electoral Commission has recommended that
  Parliament should not approve the Order](http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0014/191120/EC-briefing-ERA-Act-2013-Transitional-Provisions-Order-2015.pdf).
  \ The House of Lords must now decide what it will do. \n\n----\n\nTo find our more
