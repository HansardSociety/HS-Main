:title: 'Delegated Legislation: Frequently Asked Questions'
:slug: delegated-legislation-frequently-asked-questions
:introduction: It is widely reported that the Strathclyde review, which has been tasked
  with considering the policy powers of the House of Lords, may recommend that the
  Upper House should be stripped of their power to veto delegated legislation. But
  what is this and why is it important?
:copy: "**WHAT IS DELEGATED LEGISLATION?**\n\n* Most of the UK’s general public law
  is made not through Acts of Parliament (primary legislation) but through delegated
  legislation (also referred to as secondary or subordinate legislation).\n* Acts
  of Parliament provide a framework into which much of the real detail and impact
  of the law will subsequently be added through delegated legislation.\n* The majority
  of delegated legislation is made in the form of Statutory Instruments (SIs) that
  exist within that framework of powers delegated to ministers by Parliament in the
  parental Act. They can be used to fill out, update, or sometimes even amend primary
  legislation without Parliament having to pass a new Act. \n* The scope of delegated
  legislation varies considerably, from the very technical SI that is procedural in
  character to the wide-ranging power that can, for example, abolish quangos.\nUnlike
  primary legislation, delegated legislation is subject to judicial review.\n* The
  journey involved in making delegated legislation, from idea to implementation is
  explained in this [infographic](http://www.hansardsociety.org.uk/the-delegated-legislation-journey/).\n\n**WHY
  HAVE SUCCESSIVE GOVERNMENTS BEEN CRITICISED FOR USING DELEGATED LEGISLATION?** \n\n*
  There is a fear that Ministers are increasingly seeking to use SIs rather than Bills
  to achieve their policy objectives as these receive much less scrutiny than primary
  legislation, and take up less parliamentary time. \n* Traditionally, the justifications
  for using delegated legislation have been the need to elaborate complex and technical
  detail that cannot be easily done on the face of a Bill; the need for flexibility
  and adaptability; the advantage of involving external expertise; and the capacity
  to act quickly in times of crisis and emergency.\n* The acceptance of the system
  of delegated legislation has been predicated on its reasonable use and application
  by ministers coupled with trust in Parliament’s system of scrutiny.\n* However,
  the use of delegated legislation by successive governments has increasingly drifted
  into areas of principle and policy rather than the regulation of administrative
  procedures and technical areas of operational detail. \n* There is concern that
  delegated legislation is now being used for administrative convenience and often
  in circumstances where governments have not fully pinned down the detail of policy
  proposals. \n* There has been such an expansion in the scope and application of
  powers and procedures that a precedent could arguably be found to justify almost
  any form of delegation a minister might now desire. \n\n**HOW MUCH DELEGATED LEGISLATION
  ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?**  \n\n* Over 3,000 SIs are produced each year and on average
  Parliament scrutinises about 1,200 of them. \nBetween 1950 and 1990 the number of
  individual Sis produced each calendar year rarely rose above 2,500. From 1992 onwards,
  however, it has never dipped below 3,000.\n* A range of factors – the expansion
  of the regulatory state, the wide range of social security provision, the rapidly
  changing nature of technology, the growth in EU legislation – have all contributed
  to a significant increase in the volume, technicality and complexity of delegated
  legislation in recent years. \n\n**WHAT HAPPENS TO THOSE SIs THAT ARE CONSIDERED
  BY PARLIAMENT?**\n\n* Some SIs are simply laid before Parliament and not subject
  to scrutiny. \n* Some SIs come into effect – are the law of the land – before Parliament
  actually looks at them. In these circumstances defective legislation can sit on
  the statute book until such time as the government revokes the SI and lays an amended
  version. \n* For those SIs that are subject to parliamentary scrutiny, they are
  assigned to one of three forms of procedure: the negative procedure, affirmative
  procedure, or a strengthened or enhanced (sometimes referred to as super-affirmative)
  procedure.\n* There are no fewer than 16 variations on these three procedures, resulting
  in a system of scrutiny that is overly complex and confusing.\n\n**CAN PARLIAMENT
  AMEND STATUTORY INSTRUMENTS?**\n\n* Statutory Instruments, with just a few exceptions,
  cannot be amended by Parliament. This is because it would undermine the principle
  of delegation of power to Ministers. \n* Both Houses of Parliament are therefore
  confronted with an unpalatable ‘take it or leave it’ proposition: accept a Statutory
  Instrument even if they believe it is fundamentally flawed, or reject it entirely
  even if some elements are acceptable. This does nothing to encourage effective scrutiny
  and Member engagement with the issues. \n* Statutory Instruments are rarely rejected.
  Since 1950 the House of Commons has rejected just 11 instruments and the House of
  Lords has rejected 7 (2 of which were decisions to delay). This equates to 0.01%
  of the total SIs considered since 1965. \n* The Parliament Act does not apply to
  delegated legislation and therefore, unlike primary legislation, rejection in the
  House of Lords cannot be over-ridden by the Commons after delay. However in practice,
  Peers are mindful of the primacy of the elected House and therefore use its veto
  power sparingly. \n\n**WHY SHOULD WE BE CONCERNED ABOUT HOUSE OF LORDS SCRUTINY
  OF SIs?** \n\n* Following the House of Lords decision to delay the controversial
  Tax Credit regulations in October, the Strathclyde Review was set up to consider
  ‘how to secure the decisive role of the elected House of Commons in relation to
  its primacy on financial matters, and secondary legislation’. \n* However, if the
  House of Lords right to veto SIs is removed, this will empower the government, not
  the House of Commons. \n* A heavy burden of scrutiny responsibility falls on the
  House of Lords in large part because House of Commons procedures and the engagement
  of MPs is wholly inadequate. \n* The scrutiny process for delegated legislation
  has become unnecessarily complex such that most MPs simply don’t understand it.
  And the procedures - particularly those for praying against negative instruments
  and Delegated Legislation Committee debates for affirmative instruments – are weak.
  Many of the MPs we interviewed simply weren’t aware of the practicalities relating
  to the scrutiny of statutory instruments.\n* In contrast the House of Lords committees
  are more engaged in the process, more influential, and Peers generally have more
  appetite for the detail and technical scrutiny than most MPs. \nThe existence of
  a veto power gives purpose and leverage to the Lords’ scrutiny committees and judicious
  use of the power can have an impact in Whitehall, forcing departments to be more
  attentive. Remove it, and the influence of the House of Lords will be neutered to
  the government’s advantage unless steps are also taken to improve scrutiny of SIs
  by the House of Commons. \n* Given the inadequate nature of Commons scrutiny of
  SIs there are good reasons for enhancing the Lords scrutiny of delegated legislation
  not curtailing it. \n\n**HAS THE HOUSE OF LORDS BROKEN A CONVENTION NOT TO VETO
  SIs?** \n\n* Some have suggested that there is a convention that Peers will not
  reject an SI but this is not the case. A convention used to exist between the two
  frontbenches (but not the crossbenchers and Liberal Democrats) not to oppose regulations
  for which there was support in the Commons but this broke down in 1999 following
  the decision to abolish the hereditary peers, as was explicitly made clear by former
  leader of the House Lord Strathclyde who declared the convention dead.\n\n**WHAT
  NEEDS TO CHANGE?**\n\n* The delegated legislation process is no longer fit for purpose.
  \nThe way in which Parliament deals with delegated powers is neither systematic
  nor consistent. The [Hansard Society’s research](http://www.hansardsociety.org.uk/research/delegatedlegislation/)
  shows that too much of the process relies on ‘gut feeling’ and ‘judgement’ rather
  than objective criteria. \n* An incremental approach to reform has created a patchwork
  of procedures, resulting in a system of scrutiny that is overly complex and confusing
  and often illogical. \n* The language – ‘made’ and ‘laid’, ‘negative’, ‘affirmative’,
  and ‘super affirmative’, ‘prayers’ and ‘Henry VIII powers’ – is confusing and undermines
  parliamentary and public understanding of the legislation. Many parliamentarians
  openly admit they don’t understand them.  \n* Further patchwork reform risks making
  the situation worse. It is impossible to separate consideration of delegated legislation
  from that of primary legislation. The issues are now so serious that an independent
  expert inquiry is needed to review the entire legislative process looking at: \n
  \ * How both primary and delegated legislation is prepared in Whitehall and scrutinised
  at Westminster; \nIssues of principle and practice, and where the balance should
  lie between administrative and political convenience and good legislative process;
  \n  * Rationalisation of scrutiny procedures – exploring what criteria and principles
  define what members want to look at again in the area of delegated legislation and
  how this can best be achieved; \n  * Whether the burden on Members to scrutinise
  delegated legislation should be reduced through the introduction of individuals
  or independent advisory bodies with genuine technical expertise in particular policy
  areas; \n  * Whether the scrutiny system should be re-designed so that the greater
  burden of technical scrutiny work falls on the House of Lords in future. \n\n**DELEGATED
  LEGISLATION BY THE NUMBERS…..THE 2015 SESSION** \n\n* Since the General Election
  in May, **384** SIs have been laid before Parliament. A further **303** SIs were
  ‘carried over’ from the previous Session.\n* **85%** of these SIs have been subject
  to the negative procedure, **12%** the affirmative procedure.\n* Since May, Parliament
  has rejected **2** instruments. Both defeats were in the House of Lords and both
  times the Lords ruled to delay the instruments rather than reject them outright.
  \n* **12** prayer motions have been tabled (9 in the Commons, 3 in the Lords). Only
  **4** of these were debated. \n* Peers have tabled and debated non-fatal motions
  for 13 SIs since May.\n* In the current session, **15** SIs have been withdrawn
  and **27** ‘correcting instruments’ have been laid. Correcting instruments are issued
  to correct an earlier, defective SI.\n* There have been **66** EU-based SIs in this
  Session. \n\n**WHAT ARE THE PROCEDURES?** \n\n**(I) THE NEGATIVE PROCEDURE**\n\n*
  The vast majority (74% in 2013-14 Session) of Statutory Instruments considered by
  Parliament are subject to the [negative procedure](http://www.hansardsociety.org.uk/negative-vs-affirmative-procedures-flowchart/).
  \n* Instruments subject to this procedure become law on a stated date unless a motion
  passed in either House annulling the instrument. This motion is known as a ‘prayer’.
  If a member of either House wishes to reject a negative instrument they have to
  do so within 40 days of the instrument being laid before Parliament. \n* In the
  House of Commons, MPs table a prayer by putting it down as an Early Day Motion.
  If time is allocated, MPs have up to 90 minutes to debate the instrument.\n* In
  the House of Lords, time is usually found for debate on a prayer motion. This debate
  is not subject to a time-limit. Peers can either seek to reject the instrument or
  table a non-fatal motion, critical of the instrument without annulling it. \n\n**(II)
  THE AFFIRMATIVE PROCEDURE**\n\n* The most substantial and important pieces of delegated
  legislation are subject to a more stringent form of control and require the active
  approval of both Houses of Parliament before they can come into effect.\n* In the
  House of Commons, [affirmative instruments](http://www.hansardsociety.org.uk/negative-vs-affirmative-procedures-flowchart/)
  are referred to a Delegated Legislation Committee for debate, unless a motion for
  the debate to be held in the Commons chamber is tabled. Debates last no longer than
  90 minutes and are conducted on a ‘consideration’ motion. Following debate in committee,
  an approval motion is put formally to the House without debate on a separate day.\n*
  In the House of Lords, a motion to approve an affirmative instrument can be taken
  in either Grand Committee or on the Floor of the House. Peers can express their
  opposition or concern by making an amendment to the approval motion or by tabling
  a separate motion, effectively withholding the agreement of the House. As was the
  case in October when Peers delayed approval of the Tax Credit regulations. \n\n**(III)
  THE STRENGTHENED SCRUTINY PROCEDURES?**\n\n* There are currently 10 Acts of Parliament
  that provide for certain powers contained within them to be subjected to a higher
  level of parliamentary scrutiny than the affirmative procedure. They confer upon
  a minister a significant power to amend primary legislation (often referred to as
  a Henry VIII power). Parliament therefore has the opportunity to comment and recommend
  changes to proposals under these powers and in some cases to veto the proposed instrument. "
