:title: How the Strathclyde review could empower the government and not the House
  of Commons

:introduction: If the Strathclyde review neuters House of Lords influence on delegated
  legislation it will empower the government not the House of Commons.
:copy: "Parliament’s consideration of the controversial Tax Credit regulations in
  October reflected some of our key concerns about the scrutiny of Statutory Instruments
  (SI), in particular the heavy burden of scrutiny responsibility that falls on the
  House of Lords. Unfortunately, the Strathclyde review, which has been set up in
  direct response to the decision by the Lords to delay these regulations, may further
  weaken an already deficient delegated legislation process if it renders powerless
  its only effective feature – the influence of the Lords.\n\nLast week’s reversal
  of the planned cuts to Tax Credits finally sealed the fate of the Tax Credits (Income
  Thresholds and Determination of Rates) (Amendment) Regulations 2015. These regulations
  had effectively been placed in a state of ‘legislative purgatory’ following October’s
  decision in the House of Lords to delay their approval until the government could
  provide further information to support the impact of the policy changes. \n\nThat
  decision led to talk of a ‘constitutional crisis’ with Ministers arguing that the
  unelected Upper Chamber had no right to hold up a financial/tax measure already
  approved by MPs. In [an earlier blog post](http://blog.hansardsociety.org.uk/licence-to-kill-should-the-house-of-lords-veto-the-tax-credits-statutory-instrument/)
  we outlined why Peers would be acting within their procedural rights and responsibilities
  to take a view on the Tax Credit regulations. We also made it clear that the House
  of Lords would not be acting without cause if they rejected the SI, given the concern
  expressed by various committees, including the government’s own advisory committee,
  regarding the scant explanations and lack of available evidence provided to help
  MPs and Peers take an informed decision on the SI. \n\nNevertheless, the government
  concluded that the Lords had crossed a constitutional line and the former Leader
  of the Upper House, Lord Strathclyde has subsequently been tasked to lead a review
  to consider “how to secure the decisive role of the elected House of Commons in
  relation to its primacy on financial matters, and secondary legislation”. And in
  recent days it has been reported that one of the reform options currently being
  considered by the review panel could see the Lords stripped of their ability to
  veto delegated legislation. \n\nThis approach would be acceptable if the House of
  Commons was both willing and able to play a decisive role in the scrutiny of delegated
  legislation. But as we outlined in our report, [The Devil is in the Detail: Parliament
  and Legislation](http://www.hansardsociety.org.uk/research/delegatedlegislation/),
  published last year, this is simply not the case. \n\nThe scrutiny process for delegated
  legislation has become unnecessarily complex such that most MPs simply don’t understand
  it. And the procedures - particularly those for praying against negative instruments
  and Delegated Legislation Committee debates for affirmative instruments – are weak.
  Many of the MPs we interviewed simply weren’t aware of the practicalities relating
  to the scrutiny of statutory instruments. They did not know that they could table
  a motion against a negative instrument using an Early Day Motion (EDM), and when
  they realised, they were bemused, for EDMs are widely regarded by MPs as a waste
  of time and money. And a number of the MPs we spoke to confirmed that their party
  whips had told them that it was perfectly acceptable – indeed preferable – to get
  on with their constituency correspondence during a Delegated legislation Committee
  meeting. \n\nConsequently a heavy burden of scrutiny responsibility falls upon the
  House of Lords. Its scrutiny committees are more engaged in the process, more influential
  with government, and Peers generally have more appetite than MPs for the detail
  and technical work required to look at a thousand SIs a year. This was no more apparent
  than during the progress of the Tax Credit regulations last month. \n\nMPs and Peers
  cannot amend SIs so a key component of the effective scrutiny of delegated legislation
  in the House of Lords is the possession of a veto power. It gives purpose and leverage
  to its scrutiny committees. Judicious use of the power – something we said in our
  report it should actually utilise more regularly given the level of ministerial
  abuse of the delegated legislation process – can have a seismic impact in Whitehall,
  forcing departments to be more attentive. Without it, Peers’ influence over the
  process will be significantly diluted if not completely nullified, thus further
  empowering an already over-mighty executive in the process. \n\nGiven the inadequate
  nature of Commons scrutiny, any reform that curtails the role of the House of Lords
  in relation to delegated legislation thus risks turning an already deeply flawed
  process into a farce. Changes to the Lords should only be made once full consideration
  has been given to the role of the House of Commons. Consideration, in isolation,
  of the role of just one House in the delegated legislation process runs the risk
  of doing more harm than good. \n\nThat’s why in [our report](http://www.hansardsociety.org.uk/research/delegatedlegislation/),
  we proposed a fundamental review of the entire legislative process looking at how
  both primary and delegated legislation is prepared in Whitehall and scrutinised
  in Westminster by both Houses. The system we have for making laws is broken. The
  issues are now so serious that only a wide-ranging review will do. \n\n----\n\n**Image
