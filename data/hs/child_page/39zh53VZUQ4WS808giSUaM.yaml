:introduction: 'Our ‘Lifting the Lid’ blog series aims to open up the delegated legislation
  process by revealing the stories behind some recently published Statutory Instruments.
  This week: The Prison and Young Offender Institution (Amendment) Rules 2015.'
:copy: "Up on the committee corridor this morning (10 Nov) was the rather innocuous
  looking First Delegated Legislation Committee where a group of MPs considered the
  Prison and Young Offender Institution (Amendment) Rules 2015.\n\nThis in fact represented
  the third attempt by Parliament in 16 days to block a Statutory Instrument (SI)
  and follows hot on the heels of the two controversial votes in the House of Lords
  on Tax Credit cuts and Individual Electoral Registration. \n\nHowever, unlike the
  two SIs considered in the House of Lords, the SI debated today has very little chance
  of making it to a substantive vote on the Floor of the House due to a number of
  ‘quirks’ associated with the scrutiny procedure allocated to this type of instrument.\n\nThe
  Prison and Young Offender Institution (Amendment) Rules 2015 amend a previous instrument
  from 1999 following the outcome of a recent Supreme Court judgment which found that
  arrangements allowing prison governors to authorise segregation of a prisoner for
  periods longer than 72 hours were unlawful because the 1999 instrument required
  such decisions to be taken under the authority of the Secretary of State.\n\nThe
  revised rules allow governors in a prison, or young offender institution, to authorise
  continuing segregation beyond 72 hours for a period of up to 14 days (authority
  for which can be renewed for subsequent periods of up to 14 days). They also provide
  additional safeguards including a requirement for the Secretary of State to give
  permission before decisions can be taken to continue segregation beyond 42 days.
  \n\nHowever, organisations such as the Howard League for Penal Reform have expressed
  concern over the amendments, particularly regarding the delay in the requirement
  for external review of a segregation decision from 72 hours to 42 days.\n\nThe Rules
  are subject to the negative procedure which means that it will become law on a stated
  date unless a ‘prayer’ motion (so called because of the precise wording used in
  the formal motion) is passed in either House annulling the instrument. If a member
  of either House wishes to reject a negative instrument they have to do so within
  40 days of the instrument being laid before Parliament. \n\nIn the House of Commons,
  any member can table a ‘prayer’ as an Early Day Motion (EDM). These are motions
  for which no fixed parliamentary time has been allocated, and therefore whether
  they are heard is entirely in the hands of the government. If the official opposition
  tables a prayer motion there is some chance that it will be debated as the whips
  and business managers can seek to negotiate time for debate through the ‘usual channels’.
  This was the case with the prison institution Rules in which Labour leader Jeremy
  Corbyn successfully tabled a prayer motion via an EDM on 26 October.\n\nIf time
  is allocated to debate a prayer on the Floor of the House of Commons, MPs have up
  to 90 minutes to debate the instrument before voting on the question that the SI
  be annulled. However, the prayer motion relating to these Rules was referred to
  a Delegated Legislation Committee because the government successfully moved a ‘motion
  of referral’ last week. This means that today’s debate (also the final day of the
  SI’s 40-day scrutiny period) in committee was held on a non-fatal motion ‘that the
  Committee has considered the instrument’ so the prayer motion still has to be moved
  to the Floor of the House for the substantive annulment question to be put. This
  almost never happens because there is no requirement for a subsequent motion to
  be tabled even if today’s consideration motion was negatived. \n\nEven though the
  40-day scrutiny period will have ended, a motion could still be tabled calling for
  the rules to be revoked rather than annulled, although it would be incumbent on
  the opposition to use one of their allotted debate days for this to occur. An added
  complication is that, by then, the Prison and Young Offender Institution (Amendment)
  Rules 2015 would have been in force for over two months and given that the Ministry
  of Justice plans to review the impact and success of the amended procedures early
  next year, the opposition may perhaps be less inclined to pursue revocation after
  November recess. \n\n*To find out more about our weekly Statutory Instrument Tracker
