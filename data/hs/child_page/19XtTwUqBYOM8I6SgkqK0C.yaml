:title: Parliaments, Public Engagement and Poverty Reduction
:slug: parliaments-public-engagement-and-poverty-reduction
:introduction: This research in Bangladesh and Ethiopia explores what role parliamentary
  public engagement plays in tackling poverty reduction, through the work of MPs as
  both legislators and constituency representatives.
:copy: "## Why are we doing it? \n\nAn effective Parliament and an engaged citizenry
  are widely regarded as necessary if progress is to be made in tackling poverty reduction.
  And yet in Bangladesh and Ethiopia progress has been made towards development goals
  even though parliamentary scrutiny is weak and political opposition constrained.\n\n![Content::

  group in Durame, Ethiopia*__\n\nSo, how important are MPs, and the way they engage
  with the public (both individual citizens and civil society), in the development
  process? What roles do they play in poverty reduction and the promotion of equality
  as legislators and constituency representatives? How do they determine their priorities?
  How do they interact with different stakeholders? What makes them effective? How
  do we measure this and who decides? How can the representation of poor people's
  interests be improved? And what do they, and others, recommend for the future? \n\n##
  What are we doing? \n\nA network of researchers in Bangladesh and Ethiopia, supported
  by colleagues in the UK, are building a unique dataset on the relationships at the
  heart of the democratic institutions in these developing nations. \n\nThrough qualitative
  research at the parliamentary and constituency level - mapping, interviews and observation
  – and using anthropological, gender and actor-oriented approaches, we are: \n\n1.
  Mapping relationships between parliamentarians and members of the public involved
  in poverty reduction initiatives in both countries. \n2. Exploring the extent and
  effectiveness of public engagement by MPs in poverty reduction through legislative
  and constituency case studies. \n3. Assessing the role of Parliament and MPs in
  poverty reduction from the perspectives of a variety of stakeholders. \n4. Facilitating
  the development of researchers' capacity in three countries to measure parliamentary
  effectiveness. \n\n## Our research team \n\nThis project is a collaboration between
  SOAS (the School of Oriental and African Studies, London), the Hansard Society,
  and the Forum for Social Studies with local researchers in Bangladesh, Ethiopia
  and the UK. \n\nThe coalition of researchers, anthropologists and political scientists,
