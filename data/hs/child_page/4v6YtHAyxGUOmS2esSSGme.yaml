:title: Why Labour's 2015 campaign is a warning to a Jeremy Corbyn leadership

:introduction: Professor Steven Fielding analyses the Corbynite diagnosis of Labour’s
  failure in May and explains why the prospective leader could suffer a similar fate.
:copy: "In the immediate aftermath of Labour’s failure to win the 2015 general election,
  it looked like it would be the Blairite explanation that would prevail. Veteran
  New Labour hands launched a media offensive that ensured they set the tone for early
  interpretations of the defeat. Former minister Alan Milburn was omnipresent describing
  Ed Miliband’s electoral strategy as a ‘hideous and ghastly experiment’. According
  to Milburn and John Rentoul, the Independent commentator and Blair biographer, under
  Miliband Labour had abandoned what the latter called ‘the eternal verities of the
  Blairite truth’ by vacating the centre ground and adopting a ‘core vote strategy’.
  \n\nThis was also the view of those believed to be serious contenders to replace
  Miliband as leader. According to Liz Kendall, Labour focused too much on issues
  of concern only to the poorest voters, failing to indicate it understood middle-class
  ‘aspirations and ambitions’. Yvette Cooper claimed Miliband promoted an ‘anti-business,
  anti-growth and ultimately anti-worker’ agenda. Echoing such views, Andy Burnham
  claimed Labour should have admitted it had spent too much in government.\n\nWhen
  I began writing my analysis of Labour’s undoubtedly flawed campaign for [Britain
  Votes 2015](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Britain-Hansard-Society-Politics-Government/dp/0198748957/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1441379329&sr=1-1&keywords=britain+votes+2015),
  it was this consensus I sought to challenge. By the time I had finished however
  the one candidate who rejected that consensus was starting to take a lead in Constituency
  Labour Party nominations. But my analysis would not bring much comfort to Jeremy
  Corbyn either. For if the Blairite interpretation of Labour’s 2015 campaign is misconceived,
  the Corbynite view is even harder to reconcile with the facts.\n\n<div class=\"promo-box\">\n<p><strong>Launch

  Ed Miliband, like Corbyn, also sought to move the party on from New Labour. Like
  Corbyn he also believed the Blairite strategy needed recalibration: he thought the
  2008 banking crisis and ensuing austerity had changed politics. But despite the
  Blairite characterization, Miliband did not adopt an anti-business strategy nor
  did he disavow the centre ground.\n\nIf Blair spoke for ‘Middle England’, Miliband
  aimed to represent the ‘Squeezed Middle’, which signified that large part of the
  population whose living standards were predicted to remain below what they had been
  before the fiscal crisis for years to come. Right from the start Miliband believed,
  as an adviser put it, that ‘taking on vested interests would be his calling card’.
  He cast himself as a tribune of the people, standing up to the powerful to ensure
  fair treatment for the ‘hard-working majority’. It was this ambition that informed
  his support for: the curbing of energy prices; an investigation into invasions of
  privacy committed by News International journalists; and challenging tax avoiders.\n\nMiliband
  outlined his new course at Labour’s 2011 annual conference. Surprisingly, given
  his reputation, Miliband told those assembled that Margaret Thatcher had introduced
  necessary reforms, such as selling council houses to tenants, cutting punitive income
  tax rates and reforming trade union laws. More conventionally, he praised New Labour
  for building schools and hospitals, introducing a minimum wage and reducing child
  poverty. But both, he argued, had left unchanged ‘the values of our economy’. This
  meant that even before the banking collapse, ‘the grafters, the hard-working majority
  who do the right thing’, stopped being adequately rewarded for their efforts. Their
  ambitions were frustrated as those at the top took what they wanted and it was this
  pursuit of the ‘fast buck’, Milband, argued, that had caused the financial crisis.
  He wanted therefore to promote a fairer and therefore more efficient economy, believing
  that if workers were treated better they would become more productive and contribute
  more effectively to an expanding economy. If Miliband claimed that ‘all parties
  must be pro-business today’, he distinguished between business leaders such as Fred
  Goodwin, who ran the Royal Bank of Scotland into the ground while making millions
  for himself, with the likes of John Rose, of Rolls Royce, a man who created wealth
  and jobs. Miliband said he would support those emulating Rose, entrepreneurs, he
  termed the ‘producers’ who ‘train, invest, invent, sell’ rather than ‘predators’
  like Goodwin just interested in ‘taking what they can’. \n\nAnd yet it was this
  speech Yvette Cooper described in running for leader as ‘anti-business’. This was
  partly due to poor communication on Miliband’s part. But it was also due to the
  deliberate mangling of his message by the right-wing media, one that only became
  worse once Miliband attacked News International for its phone hacking activities.
  The Sun and Daily Mail in particular went on an unprecedented spree, assassinating
  the Labour leader’s character on a regular basis. Miliband of course gave his enemies
  much ammunition: and he arrogantly did not take presentation seriously enough. But
  that does not explain why a picture of him eating a bacon sandwich in 2014 would
  in some bizarre way come to define him. That particular shot was reproduced many
  times, on television quiz and comedy programmes as well as across the front page
  of The Sun just before polling day, replete with the headline: ‘Save Our Bacon’.
  He had become a figure of fun no sane person would trust. \n\nAs the election neared
  Miliband was persuaded to take presentation seriously but whatever improvements
  there were came too late: his person and his message were already defined, and not
  by him. These weaknesses were highlighted in the last two weeks of the short campaign.
  With opinion polls incorrectly putting Labour neck-and-neck with the Conservatives,
  the prospect of a minority Miliband government seemed real. And the idea of the
  SNP’s Nicola Sturgeon as the tail that would wag the weakly led Labour dog was one
  most disturbed the very voters whose support Miliband needed most. \n\nIn essence,
  Labour lost the general election because it was led by someone unable to convince
  a sufficient number of English voters he possessed the skills necessary to be Prime
  Minister and that his party could manage the economy.  Miliband was responsible
  for some of this: the decision to ignore Labour’s reputation for causing the banking
  crisis was his, although one wonders what good tackling that matter would have done
  the party. For the major problem Miliband suffered was the gratuitous distortion
  of his message in the press, and that which the press distorts the impartial BBC
  obligingly reports - as news.  \n\nMiliband failed to appreciate the extent to which
  his modest challenge to neo-liberal orthodoxy had to be justified in clear and popularly
  understandable terms. For, the argument that austerity was the only solution to
  the deficit was something deeply ingrained in the minds of those middle-income voters
  whose support Labour required. Too often, Miliband’s attitude to communication was
  inconsistent. Yet even had he been as skilled a communicator as the Blair of legend,
  Miliband would have struggled, given distorted perceptions of his party’s responsibility
  for the deficit, and the misrepresentations to which he was personally subject.
  \n\nAccording to Corbyn supporters, Miliband’s pledge to eliminate the deficit under
  a Labour government meant he did not give voters a clear alternative to the Conservatives.
  As a result, Corbyn plans to take the party much further down the anti-austerity
  route than did Miliband and to challenge vested interests much more than his predecessor.
  Corbyn is also more ‘unspun’ than Miliband and even less likely to take communications
  advice from experienced Labour officials. As a result, at least according to my
  understanding of the 2015 campaign, it seems unlikely that a Corbyn-led Labour party
  will much improve on Miliband’s 2015 achievement. \n\n---\n\n**Image Courtesy**:
