:introduction: 'Our ‘Lifting the Lid’ blog series aims to open up the delegated legislation
  process by revealing the stories behind some recently published Statutory Instruments.
  This week: [The Education (Student Support) (Amendment) Regulations 2015](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2015/1951/made).'
:copy: "Monday’s regret motion debate in the House of Lords on the Education (Student
  Support) (Amendment) Regulations 2015 was the final act in this SI’s rather eventful
  journey through Parliament. \n\nIntroduced in December, these regulations seek to
  replace the current means-tested student maintenance grant available to lower income
  students with a new increased loan for living costs package for new full-time students
  starting their courses in the 2016/17 academic year. \n\nThe proposal, first announced
  in July’s Budget Statement, has been criticised by organisations such as the National
  Union of Students who claimed that the government was, “trying to sneak these proposals
  through without public consultation, scrutiny, and with no mention in their manifesto
  at the election”. \n\nThis instrument is subject to the negative procedure which
  means that it will become law on a stated date unless a ‘prayer’ motion is passed
  in either House within 40 days of the instrument being laid, annulling the instrument.
  A prayer motion was tabled by the Labour Party in early January. \n\nIn a previous
  [blog post](http://blog.hansardsociety.org.uk/prisons-young-offenders/) on the Prison
  and Young Offender Institution (Amendment) Rules 2015, I outlined the process by
  which MP’s table ‘prayer’ motions via Early Day Motion (EDM) and stated that whilst
  no fixed parliamentary time is allocated to EDMs, if the official opposition tables
  a prayer motion there is some chance that it will be debated.\n\nIn that particular
  case, the government did allocate time for debate but rather than debating the motion
  on the Floor of the House, the instrument was referred to a Delegated Legislation
  Committee. Labour’s prayer against the Education (Student Support) (Amendment) Regulations
  2015 also secured time for debate, but again in committee rather than the Chamber.\n\nIn
  the 2014/15 session, nine negative instruments were prayed against in the House
  of Commons. Of those, only one, the Firefighters' Pension Scheme (England) Regulations
  2014, secured debate and that was moved on the Floor of the House. \n\nAlready in
  this session, 12 prayer motions have been tabled by MPs via EDM, nine by the official
  opposition alone. Four of the opposition’s motions have secured debate thus far,
  all of which have taken place in a Delegated Legislation Committee. \n\nIt is not
  yet clear as to why we have had so many referrals already in this session. It may
  well be that the new Labour Party leadership has taken a new approach to the scrutiny
  of statutory instruments than the one taken by its predecessor. Following the 1997
  general election, part of the opposition’s parliamentary strategy was to table prayer
  motions as a matter of course. Three hundred were tabled in just one session, 279
  of them in the name of the Leader of the Opposition, William Hague. \n\nWhat we
  do know is that referring a prayer motion to a Delegated Legislation Committee means
  that the debate can only be held on a non-fatal consideration motion. Even if the
  consideration is negatived, the instrument can only be rejected if a further substantive
  vote annulling the SI is held (without debate) on the Floor of the House. This almost
  never happens because there is no requirement for a subsequent motion to be tabled.\n\nHowever,
  the Education (Student Support) (Amendment) Regulations provide an interesting exception
  to the rule. Having already been considered in committee on 14 January, the Labour
  Party decided to use an upcoming allocated opposition day debate on 19 January to
  table the formal vote to annul the instrument themselves. Opposition days have been
  used in the past to debate prayer motions but this appears to be the first in recent
  times to proceed a previous debate on the instrument in committee. \n\nLabour also
  preceded the formal vote with a two and a half hour debate on the subject. Usually,
  any formal vote to annul an instrument must be put forthwith without debate if it
  has already been considered in a Delegated Legislation Committee. The opposition
  got around this by instead debating a related e-petition that had reached 1000,000
  signatures, calling on Parliament to prevent the removal of the maintenance grant.
  \n\nLast Thursday’s vote was also notable because it was first time that the double
  majority voting system, introduced through the English Vote for English Laws Standing
  Order changes, had been used in the Chamber on an SI. On this occasion the government
  secured the majorities of all Members and MPs for constituencies in England. If
  it had secured only one of these majorities, the instrument would have fallen. \n\nHaving
  avoided defeat on this particular regulation, the government now faces a further
  test in this policy area with Money Saving Expert founder Martin Lewis recently
  confirming his intention to [legally challenge](http://blog.moneysavingexpert.com/2016/01/15/open-letter-to-david-cameron-about-the-retrospective-student-loan-hike-2/)
  the government’s decision to freeze the student loan repayment threshold until at
  least April 2021. "
