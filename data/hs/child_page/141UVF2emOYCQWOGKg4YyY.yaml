:title: 'Future Parliament: Restoration and Reform of the Palace of Westminster '
:slug: future-parliament-restoration-and-reform-of-the-palace-of-westminster
:introduction: The proposed multi-billion pound refurbishment of the Palace of Westminster
  presents a rare one-in-150 year opportunity to reform the leading institution of
  our democracy.
:copy: "## Why are we doing it? \n\nThe refurbishment programme is the nearest we
  will come to a blank-slate for redesigning Parliament and reforming the culture
  and practice of parliamentary politics. \n\nBut if the focus is solely on fixing
  the roof, re-wiring, removing asbestos and other essential repairs then a huge opportunity
  for change will be missed. \n\nA joint committee of both Houses of Parliament is
  currently considering what should be done – in terms of decant options and the budget
  - but thus far there has been little consideration of the wider legacy opportunities
  that the restoration programme might deliver. \n\nOur new ‘Future Parliament’ project
  will help fill that gap. As well as augmenting our existing body of work about reform
  of the scrutiny and legislative processes, and the role and work of MPs, we will
  be exploring new ideas in the physical, cultural and digital spheres to help Parliament
  build a rich legacy of democratic reform. \n\n## What will we be doing? \n\nThrough
  research and events we’ll be exploring key themes including: \n\n__Democratic space__:
  spatial changes, even modest ones, can have a significant impact on the culture
  and working practices of an institution so how might Parliament benefit from thinking
  differently about its use of the estate? What principles should shape change and
  how might these be reflected in any redesign of the parliamentary estate? What are
  the opportunities to create new ‘democratic space’ for enhanced engagement with
  the public?\n\n__Future-proofing__: the ways in which we communicate and work are
  changing, so how can the refurbished Parliament be fit for the next generation and
  beyond? And what can we learn from other parliaments and public and private institutions
  around the world about how to blend innovation with tradition? \n\n__Digital democracy__:
  the pace of technological change is rapid but politics has struggled to keep up.
  Parliament now has an opportunity not just to catch up but to innovate and experiment
  – both in any temporary new facility and the refurbished building itself – so what
  might that involve? \n\n## A Place for People: A new vision for Parliament Square\n\nThe
  restoration of the parliamentary estate also provides an opportunity to take forward
  our proposals for improvements to Parliament Square. \n\nThe area is a living, working
  museum of democracy. Few areas of the world are so replete with historical, political,
  religious, cultural and architectural significance. Around the Square, through the
  history and workings of the Palace of Westminster, Westminster Abbey, the Supreme
  Court, and the buildings of Whitehall can be found our island’s democratic story.
  This nexus of Parliament, government, the church, and the courts is the constitutional
  heart of the nation. \n\nYet what should be one of the world’s greatest civic spaces
  is a noisy, polluted, inaccessible place, seething with traffic and pedestrians
  and pockmarked by fortress-like security. The overall effect is unwelcoming and
  contrary to the ideals that this public space could and should represent: a place
  of democratic assembly and engagement, citizenship and identity, celebration and
  national memory, congregation and reflection.\n\nOur report, A Place for People,
  explores how a more coherent vision for this public space might be realised to provide
  an enriched, inspiring experience for all members of the public drawn to it. Our
  proposals include: \n\n* Improved traffic management and pedestrianisation of Parliament
  Square \n* A World Heritage Site visitors centre located in the Queen Elizabeth
  II Conference Centre \n* Using new technology, such as augmented reality, to enable
  people to see the past, present and future of the built environment. For example,
  bringing alive the development of Thorney Island, and recreating ‘lost’ features
  such as the River Tyburn and the sections of the Palaces of Westminster and Whitehall
  that have now vanished. \n* A cultural and heritage corridor from Trafalgar Square
  to Tate Britain to relate our democratic story in an engaging and imaginative form
  as discerned through the mix of art, statuary and sculpture en route. \n"
