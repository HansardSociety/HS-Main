:title: Government squandered public education opportunity with dismissive response
  to anti-Trump state visit e-petition
:slug: government-squandered-public-education-opportunity-with-dismissive-response
:introduction: Last week the government had the opportunity to engage directly with
  1.8 million citizens. Presented with a communication opportunity on this scale,
  more thought and effort should have been applied to crafting the message.
:copy: "Unfortunately, what the 1.8 million signatories to the anti-Trump state visit
  e-petition got was a bland, [122-word brush-off](https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/171928?reveal_response=yes#response-threshold)
  that sounded as if it had been written by a grumpy minister forced to stay behind
  to cook up the lines after class. \n\nIt was so poor they didn’t really need to
  waste 122 words when just 33 would have sufficed. Summed up, ‘the Government believes
  the US President should be extended the full courtesy of a State Visit; the date
  and arrangements have not been finalised; and the government does not agree with
  the petition.’ \n\nIt is responses like this – that treat the public with dismissive,
  high-handed disdain – that infuriates people, in this case those who had bothered
  to sign the petition. \n\nWhether you agree with the e-petition or not, 1.8 million
  of our fellow citizens clearly felt strongly enough to support it. The request was,
  as one petitioner put it, ‘responsibly and temperately expressed’ - they hadn’t
  called for Trump to be banned from Britain, merely that he ‘not be honoured beyond
  the bare essentials due to his office’. \n\nThe government’s response has variously
  been described to me by correspondents in recent days as ‘rubbish’, ‘dismissive’,
  ‘anodyne’ and ‘abrupt’. The tone and content conveyed the impression that the government
  couldn’t be bothered properly engaging with petitioners’ concerns. \n\n**E-petitions:
  a mechanism for civic education**\n\nE-petitions are a great way to get an issue
  on to or higher up the political agenda. They can attract public and media attention
  and serve a useful ‘fire alarm’ function, providing citizens with an opportunity
  to air their views on a national platform. But they are also a means for our politicians
  to engage citizens on the issues and to facilitate deliberation on the complexities
  and nuances that underpin public policy. \n\nWith some thought, the government could
  have sent a fuller, more nuanced response which sought to grapple with the issues
  surrounding this debate. It’s clear that many people – including lots of MPs and
  journalists – don’t know how state visits work; how many there have been and by
  whom; and what role Parliament plays. (My colleague Brigid Fowler has [crunched
  the data](http://blog.hansardsociety.org.uk/president-trumps-state-visit/) so you
  don't have to!)\n\nProviding some background and context might have been useful;
  it would at least have given the impression that the government was making an effort
  to engage and explain the issues. It could have set the matter in historical and
  foreign policy context: the data suggests, for example, that historically the US
  has been neglected when it comes to state visits (and in doing so perhaps they might
  have answered the intriguing question of why Mexico has had four state visits but
  the US only two!). They might even have referenced the suggestion from the Lord
  Speaker that the rules governing the use of Westminster Hall and the wider parliamentary
  estate for State Visits be reviewed, so that the process is more transparent and
  open in the future. But instead they chose the path of least effort and so squandered
  a great public education opportunity. \n\nOur annual [Audit of Public Engagement](https://www.hansardsociety.org.uk/projects/audit-of-political-engagement)
  shows that the public is generally more likely to sign a petition than they are
  to engage in most other forms of democratic activity apart from voting. The e-petitions
  system thus has symbolic as well as practical value in better linking Parliament
  and the public. Five years ago we published a report [*What Next for E-petitions?*](https://assets.contentful.com/u1rlvvbs33ri/4cT21Ncc6kk8eWAASSA2eu/88137e59f4fa085075beefa6fe96b598/Publication__What-next-for-e-petitions-2012.pdf)
  \ outlining the reforms necessary to improve the system. Many of our proposals,
  including the setting up of a Petitions Committee, were subsequently adopted wholesale
  by the House of Commons and form the backbone of the system we have today and which
  is largely regarded as much more effective than was the case in the last Parliament.
  But this incident shows there is no room for complacency. \n\nThe government has
  to decide how responsive it is prepared to be to public concerns; it doesn’t have
  to agree with petitioners, merely be prepared to go the extra mile to communicate
  with them in a way that seeks to improve their perception of the process. If petitioners
  don’t get more thoughtful, nuanced responses the system will simply feed the anti-politics
  mood of cynicism and disdain. \n\nParliament has significantly enhanced its public
  engagement efforts through the new Petitions Committee (as Prof. Cristina Leston-Bandeira
  has explained [here](https://constitution-unit.com/2016/07/20/a-year-on-the-new-petitions-committee-has-much-to-celebrate/)).
  The Government should now do the same. Departments spend millions of pounds hiring
  consultants to put together public education advertisements for TV and social media.
  \ E-petition responses can similarly reach millions of people –  so it should start
  treating the petitioning system as a mass civic education exercise rather than a
  political nuisance. \n\n*Photo Credit: [Jay Allen]( https://www.flickr.com/photos/number10gov/32570414726/in/album-72157678120050110/)
