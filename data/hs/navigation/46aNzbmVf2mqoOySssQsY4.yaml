    ## Our mission

    The Hansard Society believes that the health of representative democracy rests on the foundation of a strong Parliament and an informed and engaged citizenry.

    An independent, non-partisan political research and education Society, our work is devoted to:

    1. __Exploring the evolution of representative democracy__: offering evidence-based ideas for reform of political and parliamentary institutions, processes and culture to help foster democratic renewal.
    2. __Educating citizens, particularly young people__: so that they have the knowledge and confidence to play an active role in our democracy and be future leaders in civic and political life.
    3. __Connecting citizens with parliamentarians and policy-makers__: through innovative on and off-line initiatives to address the democratic deficit.
    4. __Convening debate on topical political issues__: providing a non-partisan forum for the exchange of ideas about our democratic future.

    Our annual reports and information about our funding can be found on the ‘How we are funded’ section.

    ## Background

    We have a diverse funding base that serves to protect our independence – we are not dependent on any single external funder.

    Two-thirds of our annual income is generated through the Society’s services, particularly our international education programme and the sale of our quarterly journal and other publications. As a non-profit organisation, this income is then re-invested in our research and education projects and our wide-ranging public events programme. It also helps us to undertake a substantial amount of non-funded work such as providing evidence and advisory support to parliamentary committees and other public inquiries both at home and abroad.

    Some of our projects are supported through individual donations and grants from charitable trusts, foundations, research councils, parliaments, government departments, and corporate sponsors. We are extremely grateful for their generous support. However, the credibility and reputation of our work depends on it being independently produced. The Society thus retains full, independent control of all our projects including research scope and methods, editorial decisions in relation to all resource materials and publications, and the choice of speakers at our events. Committed to ethical research and transparency we always publish our findings and recommendations regardless of the views of any funder and wherever possible aim to make our work freely available to other researchers and the wider public.
